A valuable approach to the study of infertility is the comparison of mutations of individual human and mouse genes associated with infertility phenotypes. The individual gene pages in the OKdb (Ovarian Kaleidoscope Database: http://ovary.stanford.edu) contain information on associated fertility phenotypes sorted by ovarian and nonovarian defects and by subfertility or infertility. If one searches for null mutations (under mutation type) causing infertility (infertile - ovarian defect, under female fertility status) in mice (under species), 44 gene entries are found. The expression of these infertility genes in the oocyte and granulosa cells together with their cellular localization is presented in Ovarian Infertility gene map.

Hs_RANKL-RANK_Signaling_Pathway_WP2018_74133.gpml	RANKL/RANK Signaling Pathway|RANKL (Receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand), RANK (Receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B) and the natural decoy receptor of RANKL, OPG (Osteoprotegerin) are three important molecules identified to play a major role in osteoclastogenesis and bone remodelling. They are members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily. OPG was the first molecule to be discovered and proved to inhibit osteoclastogenesis both in vivo and in vitro. Unlike other members of TNF family, OPG lack a transmembrane domain and is secreted as a soluble protein by the cell. RANKL is the only known physiological agonist for its receptor, RANK. Genetic experiments have shown that mice lacking either rankl or rank suffer from severe osteoporosis and defective tooth eruption due to complete lack of osteoclasts. On the contrary, mice deficient of OPG shows osteoporosis due to increased number of osteoclasts. Binding of RANKL to RANK triggers downstream signaling events that leads to the activation of osteoclasts and controlling of lineage commitment. RANKL/RANK signaling is essential for skeletal homoeostasis and its interference leads to inhibition of bone resorption resulting in bone diseases including osteoporosis osteopetrosis and rheumatoid arthritis. RANK being a member of TNF family does not possess any kinase activity. It recruits adaptor molecules to transduce the signal after ligand binding. These adaptor molecules are called TNFR-associated factors or TRAF’s that binds to different regions in the cytoplasmic tail of the TNF family receptors and transduces the signal downstream. TRAF6 is the main adaptor molecule which activates NF-κB pathway downstream of RANKL signaling which is required for osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast activation. TRAF6 mutant mice have shown a partial block in osteoclastogenesis and defective activation of mature osteoclasts. Mice lacking NF-κB p50 and p52 proteins have been shown to be osteopetrotic. Catalytic subunits, IκB kinase α and IκB kinase β and the non-catalytic subunit IKKγ (also called NEMO) are also essential for RANKL-RANK signaling and osteoclastogenesis. IKKγ is required for osteoclastogenesis induced by RANKL in mice both in vivo and in vitro whereas IKKα was shown to be required in mice only in in vitro. Several mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK’s) have been shown to be activated downstream of RANK. Studies have shown that pharmacological inhibition of p38 MAPK’s blocked RANKL induced osteoclast differentiation. JNK1/2, its upstream kinase MKK7 and c-Jun have also been shown by genetic experiments to be essential for RANKL induced osteoclastogenesis. MAPK1 and MAPK3 phosphorylation was also shown to be dispensable for RANKL mediated osteoclast differentiation in vitro, but another report also show that specific inhibitors to MEK increased RANKL induced osteoclastogenesis suggesting a cross talk between p38 and ERK signaling pathways. NFATc1 is an essential downstream target of RANK. Ca2+ oscillations induced by RANKL activated NFATc1 resulting in terminal differentiation of osteoclasts through the Ca2+- dependent calcineurin pathway. NFATc1 translocates to the nucleus where it interacts with other transcription factors leading to the activation of transcription of genes including ACP5, CTSK, TNFRSF11A and NFATc1 under RANKL stimulation. TRAF6 and c-Src interacts with each other and with RANK upon stimulation with RANKL. This interaction increases the kinase activity of c-Src leading to the tyrosine phosphorylation of downstream molecules such as c-Cbl and activation of Akt/PKB which in turn requires the PI3-Kinase activity. Genetic experiments have shown that c-Src is very important in osteoclastogenesis. In addition to these pathways, aPKC/p62 signaling is also reported to be essential for osteoclastogenesis. Apart from their role in osteoclast differentiation and function, RANKL-RANK signaling is also required for development of lymph node and lactating mammary glands in mice and in the establishment of thymic microenvironment.

Hs_BDNF_signaling_pathway_WP2380_71549.gpml	BDNF signaling pathway|Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a neurotrophin essential for growth, differentiation, plasticity, and survival of neurons. BDNF is also required for processes such as energy metabolism, behavior, mental health, learning, memory, stress, pain and apoptosis. BDNF is implicated in various neuronal disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington’s disease, depression, and bipolar disorder.  BDNF binds to tyrosine kinase receptor known as tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB). It also binds with low affinity to p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR). BDNF and its receptors are expressed throughout the central and peripheral nervous system.  BDNF signaling is elicited when it dimerizes and binds to TrkB, resulting in the receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation. The activation of the receptor results in its interaction with molecules such as Shp2, Shc and PLC-gamma. These molecules further interact and modify their downstream targets leading to various neuronal processes. BDNF activates the signaling cascades such as PLC/PKC, PI3K/Akt, Ras/Erk, AMPK/ACC and NFB pathways. BDNF through PLC/PKC pathway leads to release of intracellular calcium and regulation of synaptic plasticity. It also maintains synaptic plasticity through cAMP/PKA signaling. Activation of PI3K/Akt pathway through BDNF/TrkB interaction inhibits cell apoptosis by decreasing the expression of BIM. However, BDNF/p75NTR interaction activates JNK through TRAF6, which leads to apoptosis. Activation of JNK3 also leads to proteolytic cleavage of the p75NTR by TACE. PI3K/Akt also leads to activation of mTOR pathway and subsequently protein synthesis. Ras/Erk signaling is involved in cell proliferation, differentiation and protection of neurons. BDNF also leads to neuronal survival through Erk5/Mef pathway. Phosphorylation of synapsin by Erk1/2 leads to neurotransmitter release. BDNF signaling leads to nitric oxide production through NFB pathway. BDNF induces neurite outgrowth through activation of JAK/STAT, Rac, and Cdc42 pathways. BDNF enhances oxidation of fat through AMPK mediated inhibition of ACC. It also plays role in microtubule assembly through inhibition of GSK3-beta. It leads to oxidative neuronal necrosis through activation of NCF molecules. BDNF also regulates the surface expression of AMPA and NMDA receptors. BDNF also regulates the expression of genes leading to processes such as differentiation of dendrites and calcification of cementoblast-like cells.

Hs_AMPK_Signaling_WP1403_73193.gpml	AMPK Signaling|AMPK signaling pathway, a fuel sensor and regulator, promotes ATP-producing and inhibits ATP-consuming pathways in various tissues. AMPK is a heterotrimer composed of alpha-catalytic and beta and gamma-regulatory subunits. Humans and rodents have two alpha and beta and three gamma isoforms; some genes are subject to alternative splicing increasing the range of possible heterotrimer combinations. Cellular stresses that inhibit ATP production or increase its consumption change the AMP:ATP ratio and activate the pathway. AMPK activation by AMP is not completely understood; the current model states that binding of AMP to the gamma subunit leads to conformational changes that allosterically activate AMPK and render phosphorylated-Thr172 unavailable for inhibitory dephosphorylation. ATP antagonizes the effect of AMP; both AMP and ATP bind in a mutually exclusive manner to the Bateman (CBS) domains of the gamma subunit. The upstream kinase, known as Lkb1, is a complex of one catalytic and two regulatory subunits; Lkb1 is believed to be âconstitutively activeâ. In certain cell types, Thr172 can be phosphorylated by calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinases (CAmKK), in turn activated by calcium. A well known role of AMPK is in the regulation of lipid metabolism; it stimulates fatty acids oxidation and inhibits their synthesis. Phosphorylation by AMPK inhibits acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and results in reduced levels of malonyl-CoA product. Malonyl CoA is a substrate in the de novo synthesis of fatty acids and fatty acids elongation. Importantly, it is also an inhibitor of the carnitine palmitoyl transferase I, required for the transfer of primed cytosolic fatty acids into the mitochondrion where they can undergo degradative beta-oxidation. AMPK inhibits mTOR signaling pathway by activating Tsc2 and downstream of Tsc2 by inhibiting Raptor component of mTOR complex 1 [note that this effect is opposite to Tsc2 phosphorylation and inactivation by PI3K-Akt signaling downstream of insulin]. AMPK is also involved in promoting glucose uptake and utilization and integrates adipokynes and hormonal signals in both the hypothalamus and the periphery with potential impact on energy expenditure and uptake by molecular mechanisms that remain to be established. Due to its roles in fuel regulation, the AMPK pathway is regarded as a potential therapeutic target for diabetes type II, obesity and metabolic syndrome. As a note, drugs used in the treatment of insulin resistance and diabetes can activate AMPK.   AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) plays a key role as a master regulator of cellular energy homeostasis. The kinase is activated in response to stresses that deplete cellular ATP supplies such as low glucose, hypoxia, ischemia and heat shock. It exists as a heterotrimeric complex composed of a catalytic Î± subunit and regulatory Î² and Î³ subunits. Binding of AMP to the Î³ subunit allosterically activates the complex, making it a more attractive substrate for its major upstream AMPK kinase, LKB1. Several studies indicate that signaling through adiponectin, leptin and CAMKKÎ² may also be important in activating AMPK.  As a cellular energy sensor responding to low ATP levels, AMPK activation positively regulates signaling pathways that replenish cellular ATP supplies. For example, activation of AMPK enhances both the transcription and translocation of GLUT4, resulting in an increase in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. In addition, it also stimulates catabolic processes such as fatty acid oxidation and glycolysis via inhibition of ACC and activation of PFK2. AMPK negatively regulates several proteins central to ATP consuming processes such as TORC2, glycogen synthase, SREBP-1 and TSC2, resulting in the downregulation or inhibition of gluconeogenesis, glycogen, lipid and protein synthesis. Due to its role as a central regulator of both lipid and glucose metabolism, AMPK is considered to be a key therapeutic target for the treatment of obesity, type II diabetes mellitus, and cancer.

Hs_Primary_Focal_Segmental_Glomerulosclerosis_FSGS_WP2572_72200.gpml	Primary Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis FSGS|Primary or idiopathic focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) a cause of nephrotic syndrome in children and adolescents, as well as an important cause of end stage renal disease in adults. FSGS is mainly associated with foot process effacement, proliferation of mesangial, endothelial and epithelial cells in the early stages followed by collapse of glomerular capillaries leading to scarring. It may lead to dramatic manifestations such as proteinuria, hypoaluminemia, and hypertension. Also, there are many inheritable genetic abnormalities that can cause podocyte damage of FSGS caused by mutations in proteins that are important for podocyte function. The genes include CD2AP, MYO1E, WNT1, and LAMB2. On the far left, the diagram illustrates molecular interactions between a normal podocyte and matrix interactions. ACTN4 and SYNPO and DAG1 interacting with AGRN associate with the actin cytoskeleton; these actin associated proteins might play a role in maintaining podocyte and GBM architecture. DAG1 binds to UTRN, which in turn binds an actin filament, thus completing the link between the actin-based cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix. Podocyte foot processes are anchored to the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) via ITGB1 and ITGA3 integrin complex and DAG1-UTRN complex. Transmembrane proteins such as LAMA5 and CD151 bind to ITGB1 and ITGA3, respectively. The intracellular integrins combine with cytoskeletal via intermediates which include TLN1, VCL, and PAX complex and the ILK, PARVA, and LIMS1 complex. (Guanghua Hu et. al 2013 - Biomedicine and Aging Pathology vol 3) Upon primary podocyte injury, there are multiple pathways involved in podocyte injury. "Sustaining NPHS1 and phosphorylation might contribute to both anti-apoptotic signaling and actin polymerization. The CD80 pathway may be targeted by TLR4 or blocking the binding of B7-1 to slit diaphragm structure proteins such as KIRREL2/3. PLAUR could be inhibited by interfering with binding of PLAUR and ITGAV/B3 integrin, inhibiting ITGB3 integrin activation, or inhibiting binding of ITGAV/B3 integrin to VTN. The notch pathway can be targeted by interfering with its upstream activation by blocking the TGF-β1 effect, inhibiting γ-secretase, which is required for proteolytic receptor activation, or interfering with target gene transcription." (Reiser J. et al 2010 - Kidney Int vol 77) Post podocyte development, increased activation of NOTCH1 and WNT/CTNNB1 activities contribute to glomerulosclerosis. Expression of JAG1 on the ligand-expressing cell induces proteolytic cleavage of the Notch receptor on the signal-receiving cell, releasing the NOTCH1. DKK1 inhibits WNT1 binding to LRP5/6. By inhibiting the destruction of CTNNB1, CTNNB1 is stablilized. "The CTSL pathway could be targeted by specifically inhibiting CTSL expression or activity, shifting the equilibrium of SYNPO toward the phosphorylated form by inhibiting calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation or enhancing PKA or CAMK2B-mediated phosphorylation, protecting SYNPO and DNM1 by compounds that bind to the CTSL cleavage site, or delivering cleavage-resistant SYNPO and DNM1 mutants." (Reiser J. et al 2010 - Kidney Int vol 77) The destruction of podocyte’s cytoskeleton architecture leads to lose of normal podocyte epitopes such as VIM, SYNPO, and WT1, and lose of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors CDKN1C and CDKN1B. Also, podocytes acquire proliferation of CDKN1A. This leads to podocytopenia which have been shown to cause primary FSGS and then followed by end-stage renal disease (ESRD). FSGS is also induced by microRNA-193a and its downregulation of WT1, destroying podocyte foot processes. There is insufficient evidence that segmental glomerular lesions can be caused by other drugs or toxins, apart from some used experimentally such as doxorubicin and puromycin aminonucleoside.  Treatments such as steroids, high-dose cyclosporine, ritxuximab can reduce proteinuria based on their immunosuppressive properties and through stabilization of the podocyte actin cytoskeleton.

Hs_TSH_signaling_pathway_WP2032_72116.gpml	TSH signaling pathway|Human thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is a glycoprotein secreted by the anterior part of the pituitary gland (1). TSH plays an important physiological role in the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis by modulating the release of the thyroid hormones from the thyroid gland. TSH is mainly expressed in adenohypophysis , thyroid gland, leukocyte, pituitary gland, stratum basale, stratum corneum, stratum granulosum, stratum spinosum and keratinocyte (2-4). Impairment of TSH signal transduction pathway leads to thyroid disorders such as goitre, hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, with complex clinical manifestations.  TSH is a heterodimer with one alpha and one beta subunit associated non-covalently. The binding of TSHB to TSHR triggers conformational changes that are transmitted through the intracellular receptor domains to promote coupling between the receptor and its cognate heterotrimeric G proteins. The TSHR activation stimulates the catalytic exchange of GDP for GTP on the Ga subunit and subsequently induces the dissociation of the GTP-bound Ga subunit from the Gß? subunit heterodimer. TSHR is reported to interact with GNA12, GNA13, GNAQ, GNAO1, GNAI2, GNAI1, GNAI3, GNAS and GNA11 G-protein subunits (5). Once dissociated, free Ga-GTP and Gß? subunits regulate the activity of enzymatic effectors, such as adenylate cyclases to generate cAMP (6, 7). cAMP activate Rap1A (Ras-Related Protein-1A) and Rap1B (Ras-Related Protein Rap1B) (8, 9). cAMP productions leads to the activation of PKA by the dissociation of regulatory subunits. Activated PKA phosphorylates its target proteins. One of the PKA substrate is the nuclear transcription factor CREB, which activates the transcription of cAMP-responsive genes after upon phosphorylation by PKA (10, 11).  TSHR also mediates its effects through Janus Kinases and Ras effectors. JAK kinases phosphorylate and activate STAT transcription factor, particularly STAT1 and STAT3 (12, 13, 14)¬¬¬¬. RAS is a guanine nucleotide-binding protein that is a key intermediate in signal transduction pathways. The RAS activation, followed by BRAF recruitment leads to the activation of the MAP kinases (ERK1/2). ERKs, once activated, translocates to the nucleus to phosphorylate several nuclear targets. In addition to JAK/STAT and Ras/MAP kinase pathways, TSH also activates PI3K (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase). A major downstream target of PI3K pathway is the serine/threonine Kinase AKT that is involved in mediating stimulation of cell proliferation by inhibiting apoptosis (15, 16). AKT and MTOR raptor complex phosphorylation leads to activation of downstream signaling.

Hs_Hedgehog_Signaling_Pathway_WP47_70092.gpml	Hedgehog Signaling Pathway|The Hedgehog family of proteins are signaling proteins that are crucial for a number of physiological processes including morphogenesis during development. In adult organisms, it is also involved in the regulation of theca cell development in growing follicles and in regulating the development and function of the somatic cells of the testis. Vertebrates are known to have 3 Hedgehog genes, which show different spatio-temporal expression patterns and perform specialized functions. These are - Desert hedgehog (Dhh), Indian hedgehog (Ihh), and Sonic hedgehog (Shh). The Patched (PTCH) proteins (Patched 1 and Patched 2 - PTCH1 and PTCH2) serve as receptors for the Hedgehog proteins. In the 'off' state, PTCH receptors inhibit the Smo protein by mechanism(s) which are still not understood completely. In this state, the Gli2/3 Zn-finger transcription factors are phosphorylated and processed in a proteasome-dependent manner to generate a transcriptionally repressor form. SUFU, a cytoplasmic protein, was also found to interact with all the three Gli proteins resulting in the repression of its transcriptional activity. In the 'Signaling cell', which is the cell which secretes the Hedgehog proteins, an active ligand is produced following processing of the precursor Hedgehog protein. This processing involves autocleavage by the catalytic domain and bi-lipidation (cholesterol moiety at C-terminus and palmitate at the N-terminus) of the Hedgehog protein. These active ligands travel to the 'responding cell' via interactions with glypicans and megalin. On the responding cell, the active ligand interacts with PATCHED 1 (PTCH1) and PATCHED 2 (PTCH2), which results in the activation and translocation of Smoothed (Smo) to the cilium(plasma membrane in Drosophila). Activation of Smo results in the inhibition of Gli proteolysis and the production of the transcriptional repressor form. This might also promote the formation of the transcription activator form of the protein. The G-protein coupled receptor kinase-2 enhances the association between β-arrestin 2 and Smo probably by phosphorylating Smo. The two proteins also mediates increased internalization of Smo in a clathrin- dependent process and increased Hedgehog signaling. Kif7, a Drosophila Costal2 (Cos2) homolog, is capable of interacting with the Gli proteins and is known to exert positive and negative effects on Hedgehog signaling. The Fused (Fu) homolog, which can form a complex with Kif7, Gli and and SuFu (similar to Drosophila Gli, Cos2, Su and SuFu) may also be involved in the regulation of this pathway.

Hs_TCR_Signaling_Pathway_WP69_72111.gpml	TCR Signaling Pathway|The T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) complex is composed of a ligand-binding subunit, the α and β chains, and a signaling subunit, namely the CD3ε, γ and δ chains and the TCRζ chain. This complex participates in T-cell activation upon the presentation of the antigen peptide (derived from the foreign antigen) bound to the MHC (Class I and Class II) residing on antigen-presenting cells (APCs), including dendritic cells, macrophages and B cells. Co-stimulatory receptors, such as CD2, CD28, CD4, CD8, and integrin molecules, contribute to signal transduction by modulating the response threshold. All the above components along with accessory proteins essential for MHC are a part of the immunological synapse that initiates T-cell activation.  Protein tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by the Src family kinases Lck and Fyn, in turn regulated by CD45, is the initial event in TCR signaling. Lck is activated by the interaction of MHC and CD4 or CD8. It then induces the phosphorylation and activation of TCR-CD3 complex and eventually mediates Fyn activation. The activated Src kinases phosphorylate ITAMs (Immune receptor tyrosine-based activation motifs) present on CD3γ, δ, ε and ζ chain. The 70-kd ζ chain–associated protein kinase (ZAP70) is then recruited to the ITAMs followed by its phosphorylation and subsequent activation which results in further amplification of the response. These activated PTKs induce tyrosine phosphorylation of several polypeptides, including the transmembrane adaptor LAT (Linker Activator for T-Cells). Protein tyrosine phosphorylation subsequently leads to the activation of multiple pathways, including ERK (Extracellular Signal Regulated Kinase), JNK (c-Jun N-terminal Kinase), NF-κB (Nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells 1) and NFAT(Nuclear Factor of Activated T-Cells) pathways, which ultimately induce effector functions.  CD28 ligation by B7-1 or B7-2 helps in bringing the T-Cell and Antigen Presenting Cell membranes into close proximity. This event also provides a co-stimulatory signal leading to the production of IL-2 and T- cell activation. Besides CD28, many other transmembrane receptors also modulate specific elements of TCR signaling. CD28 and CD45 activate Lck which in turn induces the phosphorylation and activation of the TCR-CD3 complex and consequently, the tyrosine kinases Fyn and ZAP70. CD45 plays a role in antagonizing the effect of inhibitory proteins on T-cell activation. ZAP70 induces activation of LAT (Linker for Activation of T-Cells), an integral membrane adaptor protein which further binds to GADS (Growth Factor Receptor-Bound Protein-2-Related Adaptor Protein-2), SLP76 (SH2 Domain-Containing Leukocyte Protein-76), and ITK (IL-2 inducible T-cell kinase). This complex facilitates the activation of PLCG1 (Phospholipase-C-Gamma1) that is responsible for the production of the second messengers DAG (Diacylglycerol) and IP3 (Inositol Triphosphate). DAG activates proteins including PKCθ (Protein Kinase-C-Theta) and Ras, whereas IP3 leads to Ca2+ release from ER and also facilitates influx of extracellular calcium. Increased intracellular Ca2+ activates the phosphatase Calcineurin that dephosphorylates NFAT which then enters the nucleus and promotes transcription.  Activated LAT also binds multiple adaptor proteins including GRB2, GRAP (GRB2- Related Adaptor Protein) and GADS to facilitate activation of serine/threonine kinases such as Raf1, MEK (MAPK/ERK Kinase) and dual-specificity kinases ERK1/2 that are involved in activation of MAPKs (Mitogen activated protein kinases) resulting in the induction of transcription factor Elk1.  ZAP70 also activates IKKs via the CARD11 (Caspase recruitment domain family, member 11) -BCL10 (B-Cell CLL/lymphoma-10)-MALT1 (Mucosa Associated Lymphoid Tissue Lymphoma Translocation Gene-1) complex and MAP3K (activated by PKCθ) which in turn relieve NF-κB of IκB (NF-kappa-B inhibitor beta) and allow its nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation. ZAP70 also activates p38 via Vav, Rac and MKK3/6 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase-3 / Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase-6). p38 then activates the transcription factor ATF2 (Activating Transcription Factor-2).  Activated Rac also activates JNK via MEKK1 and MKK4/7 (MKK4 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase-4/ Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase-7) which eventually leads to activation of c-Jun mediated transcription.  SIT (SHP2-Interacting Transmembrane Adaptor Protein) and CTLA4 (Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen-4) are transmembrane adaptor proteins that interact with the SHP2 (SH2-containing Protein tyrosine Phosphatase-2) and negatively regulate T-cell activation by inhibiting the phosphorylation of Fyn and CD28 respectively. CTLA4 has a greater affinity for its B7-1/B7-2ligands in comparison toCD28 and thus competes for them. During T-cell activation CTLA4 is endocytosed to quicken the response. ZAP70 facilitates translocation of CTLA4 to the membrane when the response needs to be controlled. PAG (Phosphoprotein Associated with Glycosphingolipid Microdomains), a transmembrane adaptor molecule is associated with CSK (c-Src Tyrosine Kinase), an inhibitor of Src-related protein tyrosine kinases. Overexpression of PAG inhibits TCR-mediated responses.  Dual specificity phosphatase 3 (DUSP3) or VHR is also induced by ZAP70 which consequently down regulates ERK activation and thus controls T-cell response.

Hs_Endochondral_Ossification_WP474_72122.gpml	Endochondral Ossification|Endochondral ossification is the process by which the embryonic cartilaginous model of most bones contributes to longitudinal growth and is gradually replaced by bone. During endochondral ossification, chondrocytes proliferate, undergo hypertrophy and die; the cartilage extracellular matrix they construct is then invaded by blood vessels, osteoclasts, bone marrow cells and osteoblasts, the last of which deposit bone on remnants of cartilage matrix. The sequential changes in chondrocyte behaviour are tightly regulated by both systemic factors and locally secreted factors, which act on receptors to effect intracellular signalling and activation of chondrocyte-selective transcription factors. Systemic factors that regulate the behaviour of chondrocytes in growth cartilage include growth hormone and thyroid hormone, and the local secreted factors include Indian hedgehog, parathyroid hormone-related peptide, fibroblast growth factors and components of the cartilage extracellular matrix.

Hs_Allograft_Rejection_WP2328_74457.gpml	Allograft Rejection|This pathway illustrates molecular interactions involved in the fundamental adaptive immune response for allograft destruction. This pathway was adapted in large part from the KEGG pathway http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway/hsa/hsa05330.html. In the initial step of this diagram, antigen presenting cells (APC‚Äôs), either those from the donor (direct pathway) or from the recipient (indirect pathway) activate naive t cells leading to both CD8+ and CD4+ T cell maturation. CD8+ stimulated T cells lead to apoptosis of the allograft donor cells whereas CD4+ T cells differentiate into TH1, TH2, T17, and Treg cells. Activated TH1 produces TNFA and NO and damages donor graft cells by cytotoxicity. TH2 cell activates B cells. Activated B cells lead to plasma cell formation followed by IgG antibodies and the complement cascade pathway in acute antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) and chronic AMR with C3 being the therapeutic target. Exogenous treatment with YCF inhibits C3, thus preventing AMR. Eculizumab binds to C5 which prevent C5a production and the membrane attack complex.  C3a and C35 act as potent chemotactic factors, promoting the infiltration of pro-inflammatory cells. Belatacept inhibits CD80/86 binding to CD28. Corticosteroids inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokines. Corticosteroids contribute to immune suppression such as CTLA4 which inhibits T-cell activation.

Hs_Kit_receptor_signaling_pathway_WP304_72102.gpml	Kit receptor signaling pathway|Kit is a cytokine receptor that belongs to the type III receptor tyrosine kinase family. It is structurally similar to platelet-derived growth factor recpetors (PDGFRs), colony stimulating factor-1 receptor and fms-like tyrosine kinase. Kit signaling is plays important role in a number of physiological processes including erythropoiesis, lymphopoiesis, mast cell development and function, megakaryopoiesis, gametogenesis and melanogenesis. Sequence alterations in the c-kit gene are found to be associated with different cancers including hematopoietic malignancies, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, germ cell tumors, small-cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer. The primary ligand for kit receptor is stem cell factor (SCF). It is also known as Kit ligand, steel factor or mast cell growth factor. SCF is a glycosylated, non-covalent homodimer. Alternative splicing and proteolytic cleavage results in soluble and membrane bound forms of the protein. that binds to two KIT monomers. Binding of SCF to KIT results in the dimerization of the receptor and its autophsphorylation. The residues that are known to get phosphorylated upon ligand binding include Tyr568, Tyr570, Tyr703, Tyr721, Tyr730, Tyr823, Tyr 900 and Tyr936. Signaling events downstream of the KIT receptor are well studied. Among the signaling cascades that are activated are the Ras/Raf/MEK/MAPK and the PI3K/AKT/RPS6K pathways. KIT stimulation is also known to activate the JAK/STAT and PLC/PKC signaling pathways. Among the other key proteins that are regulated by KIT are the kinases BTK, TEC, LYN, SRC, FYN and JNK. Regulation of KIT receptor tyrosine kinase occurs through many mechanisms. Activated KIT receptors are degraded via CBL, a E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase. CBL induces the degradation of the receptor via the proteasome or lysosome. KIT can also be dephosphorylated and inactivated by the protein tyrosine phosphatase Shp1. Also, activation of protein kinase C results in a negative feedback loop, wherein it phosphorylates specific serine residues leading to the inactivation of KIT.

Hs_TWEAK_Signaling_Pathway_WP2036_72733.gpml	TWEAK Signaling Pathway|TNF related weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) is a small pleiotropic cytokine of the TNF super family and its gene is located at chromosome 17p13.1. TWEAK has been reported to be expressed in tissues that include heart, brain, kidney and also in mononuclear blood cells. The multiple biological activities of TWEAK include stimulation of cell growth and angiogenesis, induction of inflammatory cytokines, and stimulation of apoptosis. It has been shown to be involved in the induction of cellular proliferation in liver cells, osteoblasts, astrocytes, synoviocytes, kidney cells and skeletal muscles. Furthermore, TWEAK plays a substantial role in cellular differentiation in osteoclasts. TWEAK induces glioma cell survival via imparting resistance to cytotoxic agents. It imparts its downstream signaling events by binding to its receptor, FGF inducible 14 protein (Fn14). Two modes of TWEAK-Fn14 (ligand-receptor) interactions have been proposed (i) the ligand dependent interaction which involves the higher concentration of homotrimeric TWEAK, that binds to low concentration of Fn14 in a heterohexameric complex (ii) ligand-independent interaction when the ligand concentration is lower than the receptor concentration which induces the ligand independent interaction. The receptors homotrimerize to activate the downstream events. The signaling cascades reported under TWEAK-Fn14 interactions are the canonical and noncanonical NF-κB pathways and the MAPK pathway. There has been a report on crosstalk between Wnt and TWEAK pathways. In myoblasts the PI3K-AKT module has been reported to be inhibited under TWEAK stimulus. AKT phosprorylation leads to the activation of GSK3β resulting in increase of phospho-GSk3β and active β-catenin1 (CTNNB1) (dephosphorylated) levels. GSK3β and β-catenin1 remain associated in the cytoplasm, phosphorylation of GSK3β leads to the dissociation of β-catenin1 (dephosphorylated) resulting in the nuclear translocation of the protein. Despite of reports on TWEAK binding to other receptors including CD163 and DR3 the downstream events following the binding is yet to be established. The data provided by us would foster enormous avenues for further studies on TWEAK associated proteins and the related disorders such as cancer and autoimmune diseases. The data would enable therapeutic studies by selecting the pathological events and the simultaneous production of blocking agents. Despite the minimal amount of data, ours can also be used in the overlay of various high throughput data enabling pathway analysis and can be accessed by any pathway resource to generate a customized pathway.

Hs_DNA_Replication_WP466_70091.gpml	DNA Replication|Studies in the past decade have suggested that the basic mechanism of DNA replication initiation is conserved in all kingdoms of life. Initiation in unicellular eukaryotes, in particular Saccharomyces cerevisiae (budding yeast), is well understood, and has served as a model for studies of DNA replication initiation in multicellular eukaryotes, including humans. In general terms, the first step of initiation is the binding of the replication initiator to the origin of replication. The replicative helicase is then assembled onto the origin, usually by a helicase assembly factor. Either shortly before or shortly after helicase assembly, some local unwinding of the origin of replication occurs in a region rich in adenine and thymine bases (often termed a DNA unwinding element, DUE). The unwound region provides the substrate for primer synthesis and initiation of DNA replication. The best-defined eukaryotic origins are those of S. cerevisiae, which have well-conserved sequence elements for initiator binding, DNA unwinding and binding of accessory proteins. In multicellular eukaryotes, unlike S. cerevisiae, these loci appear not to be defined by the presence of a DNA sequence motif. Indeed, choice of replication origins in a multicellular eukaryote may vary with developmental stage and tissue type. In cell-free models of metazoan DNA replication, such as the one provided by Xenopus egg extracts, there are only limited DNA sequence specificity requirements for replication initiation.

Hs_Vitamin_D_Metabolism_WP1531_74057.gpml	Vitamin D Metabolism|Photochemical synthesis of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol, D3) occurs cutaneously where pro-vitamin D3 (7-dehydrocholesterol) is converted to pre-vitamin D3 (pre-D3) in response to ultraviolet B (sunlight) exposure. DHCR7 encodes the enzyme 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) reductase, which converts 7-DHC to cholesterol, thereby removing the substrate from the synthetic pathway of vitamin D3, a precursor of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3.The finding that common variants at DHCR7 are strongly associated with circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations suggests that this enzyme could have a larger role in regulation of vitamin D status than has previously been recognised. Vitamin D3, obtained from the isomerization of pre-vitamin D3 in the epidermal basal layers or intestinal absorption of natural and fortified foods and supplements, binds to vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) in the bloodstream, and is transported to the liver. D3 is hydroxylated by liver 25-hydroxylases (25-OHase). The resultant 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25(OH)D3) is 1-hydroxylated in the kidney by 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-1 -hydroxylase (1-OHase). This yields the active secosteroid 1 ,25(OH)2D3 (calcitriol), which has different effects on various target tissues. The synthesis of 1,25(OH)2D3 from 25(OH)D3 is stimulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH) and suppressed by Ca2+, Pi and 1,25(OH)2D3 itself. The rate-limiting step in catabolism is the degradation of 25(OH)D3 and 1,25(OH)2D3 to 24,25(OH)D3 and 1,24,25(OH)2D3, respectively,which occurs through 24-hydroxylation by 25-hydroxyvitamin D 24-hydroxylase (24-OHase), encoded by the CYP24A1 gene. 24,25(OH)D3 and 1,24,25(OH)2D3 are consequently excreted. Vitamin D activity is mediated through binding of 1,25(OH)2D3 to the vitamin D receptor (VDR), which can regulate transcription of other genes involved in cell regulation, growth, and immunity. VDR modulates the expression of genes by forming a heterodimer complex with retinoid-X-receptors (RXR).	D	VDR	CYP24A1	CYP27B1	CYP27A1	RXRB	DHCR7	RXRA	CYP2R1

Hs_EGF-EGFR_Signaling_Pathway_WP437_72106.gpml	EGF/EGFR Signaling Pathway|Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) also known as ErbB1/HER1 is a member of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases  which also includes ErbB2 (Neu, HER2), ErbB3 (HER3) and ErbB4 (HER4). Several ligands such as epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor-alpha, epigen,  amphiregulin, betacellulin, heparin-binding EGF and epiregulin are known to specifically bind to EGFR. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is one of the high affinity  ligands of EGFR. EGF/EGFR system induces growth, differentiation, migration, adhesion and cell survival through various inter-acting signaling pathways. The binding of  EGF to the extracellular domain of EGFR induces the dimerization, activation of intrinsic kinase activity and subsequent autophosphorylation of EGFR at multiple residues  in the cytoplasmic region such as Tyr 1092, Tyr 1172, Tyr 1197, Tyr 1110, Tyr 1016). Activated EGFR recruits various cytoplasmic proteins which transduce and regulate the  EGFR function. The proteins recruited to active EGFR include many Src homology 2 (SH2) and phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain containing proteins which binds to the  tyrosine phosphorylated residues in EGFR, enzymes which act on EGFR and also various EGFR substrates. One of the adapter proteins, GRB2, binds to the phosphotyrosine  residue at 1068 and recruits SOS to the membrane. SOS activates GDP/GTP exchange which recruits RAF to the membrane. RAF phosphorylates MEKs, which then activates the  extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK). ERK activates a number of transcriptional regulators to induce cell growth and proliferation. GRB2 or other adaptor proteins  such as GABs recruits PI3Ks, another major mediator of EGFR signaling. PI3Ks convert Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3).  PIP3 binds to PH domain of AKT and recruits it to plasma membrane. PDK1 phosphorylates AKT which in turn regulate the activity of various proteins that mediate cell  survival. EGFR also activate phospholipase C which hydrolyses PIP2 to generate Inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and 1,2-Diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 induces the release of Ca2+  from endoplasmic reticulum to activate calcium regulated pathways. DAG activates protein kinase C pathway. One of the signaling modules regulated by PKC in EGFR pathway is  the NFKB module. The protein SRC is a key player in the activation of various pathways such as RAS, PLC and also the STAT proteins in various cells. Other signaling modules  activated by EGFR include the FAK, JNK, p38MAPK and ERK5 modules. EGFR induces the JNK pathway through the activation of G proteins such as RAC and CDC42 which recruits JNK  kinases as well as regulate the actin polymerization.  EGFR also translocates from the plasma  membrane to other cellular compartments including nucleus where it directly  regulate the expression of several genes in cooperation with other transcriptional regulators such as STATs, PCNA and E2F family of proteins. Being a growth, differentiation  and cell survival factor; mutations and overexpression of EGFR and also the defective regulation of its signal transduction pathways has been established to be associated  with oncogenesis. Thus, EGFR and its signaling components are promising targets for effective therapy for various cancers. There are several proteins which have been reported  to regulate the EGFR signaling such as CBL, CSK, PKC and PTEN which promotes endocytosis or reduction in the EGFR activity or its signaling mediators. The major endocytic pathway  of EGFR is established to be the clathrin coated pits which delivers them to endosomes. The endosomal pathway recycles the membraneous form of EGFR or form multivesicular bodies (MVB)  and fuse with lysosomes for to the degradation pathway.

Hs_IL-3_Signaling_Pathway_WP286_72139.gpml	IL-3 Signaling Pathway|Interleukin 3 (IL-3) is a potent growth factor belonging to the super family of cytokines. IL-3 is a 20- 32kDa glycoprotein involved in the process of hematopoiesis. It is involved in the proliferation and differentiation of pleuripotent hematopoietic stem cells, progenitor cells and their mature progeny. IL-3 is a growth factor for B lymphocytes. It also activates monocytes and augments survival and propagation of mast cells, eosinophils and stromal cells. IL-3 is secreted predominantly by activated T lymphocytes in response to immunological stimuli and to a lesser extent by mast cells and eosinophils. IL-3 exerts influence on different biological activities, primarily hematopoiesis by associating with the IL-3 receptor. This receptor is a heterodimeric complex and consists of an alpha chain- IL3RA and a beta chain CSF2RB, shared with the receptors for granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor and Interleukin-5. When IL-3 binds to CSF2RB receptor, adapter proteins like SHC1, GRB2 and SOS1 are recruited to activate HRAS. HRAS stimulates RAF1 which further activates MAP2K1 and finally MAPK1 and MAPK3. The signals generated through this pathway are then transmitted to the nucleus leading to the activation of various transcription factors such as JUN and FOS which are involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. IL-3 mediated activation of HRAS also inhibits apoptosis through phosphatidyl inositol 3 kinase/ AKT pathway. The activation of AKT1 in response to IL-3 stimulation leads to the phosphorylation of the apoptotic regulator, BCL2-associated agonist of cell death (BAD), its binding to 14-3-3 and sequestration into the cytoplasm. IL-3 stimulation activates Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) by its phosphorylation. JAK2 in turn phosphorylates signal transducer and activator of transcription 5A and 5B. These translocate to the nucleus, serving the purpose of transcription factor for early genes as well as a feedback inhibitor of the JAK-STAT pathway. IL-3, in addition, is known to activate various tyrosine kinases such as LYN, FYN, SRC, SYK, TEC1 and HCK. The interactions and intersections between canonical and noncanonical IL-3 signaling systems are depicted in the pathway map.

Hs_ID_signaling_pathway_WP53_67360.gpml	ID signaling pathway|The Inhibitor of DNA binding (ID) proteins belong to the class V HLH family of transcription factors. Four ID proteins (ID 1-4)are known in humans. Unlike the basic HLH (bHLH) transcription factors, ID proteins lack the basic DNA binding region. They can heterodimerize with class I bHLH transcription factors to form inactive complexes. They thus act as dominant negative inhibitors of the class I bHLH transcription factors. They are also capable of regulating the activity of class II HLH transcription factors. Since, class I and II HLH proteins regulate the expression of cell type-specific genes and differentiated phenotype, ID proteins are thought to regulate the cross-talk between the pathways involved in cell growth and differentiation. Aberrant expression of ID proteins are found in many primary tumors and are found to regulate many steps in cancer progression including neo-angiogenesis, invasion and migration, proliferation and growth, cell-cell interaction and differentiation. These include head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, hepatocellular carcinonoma, pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, breast cancer  and prostate cancer. Among the transcription factors that ID proteins associate with are the Ets family members (ELKs)  and paired box family (PAXs). They can also bind to the retinoblastoma and retinoblastoma-like proteins (RBLs), which are thought to be tumor suppressors. IDs can also be phosphorylated by CDK2.

Hs_Myometrial_Relaxation_and_Contraction_Pathways_WP289_72107.gpml	Myometrial Relaxation and Contraction Pathways|This pathway illustrates signaling networks implicated in uterine muscle contraction at labor and quiescence throughout gestation (pregnancy). The muscle of the uterus, responsible for contractile activity is the myometrium. Genes in this pathway are either transcribed in myometrial muscle cells or act upon the myometrium to regulate contraction. The left half of this pathway illustrates pathways of myometrial relaxation that are active throughout normal gestation. These signaling events act to suppress coordinated contractions to prevent the early onset of labor at term, largely via activation of the adenylyl-cyclase thrhough G-protein coupled receptors. On the right side of this pathway are signaling componets involved in the activation of uterine contractions at labor, in particular, activation of calcium mobilization via Oxytocin mediated binding to the Oxytocin G-protein coupled receptor. Additional genes implicated in this pathway, based on microarray expression profiling of gestation, term and postpartum of term mice are also included (e.g., Guca2b, Rdc1, Edg2) have also been included.

Hs_Spinal_Cord_Injury_WP2431_74098.gpml	Spinal Cord Injury|This pathway provides an overview of cell types, therapeutic targets, drugs, new proposed targets and pathways implicated in spinal cord injury. Spinal cord injury is a complex multistep process that involves the regulation of gene expression and signaling in motor neurons, oligodentrocytes, microglia, and astrocytes that trigger immediate immune responses lasting several weeks. Within 24 hours, chemoattractants  and cytokines released from the site of injury activate neutrophils which further recruit B and T cells or recruit monocytes that ultimately result in infiltration and activation by microglia and macrophages. These immune responses result in inflammation, excitotoxicity, cell death, formation of glial scar, and suppression of axonal regeneration. An increase in the expression of cell cycle genes further results in proliferation of astrocytes and microglia that leads to apoptosis and necrosis of oligodentrocytes and neurons. An example therapy is the administration of the immunosuppressant FK506, also used in transplantation to offer neuroprotection.

Hs_Corticotropin-releasing_hormone_WP2355_71393.gpml	Corticotropin-releasing hormone|Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is a neuropeptide secreted abundantly in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, amygdala, cerebral cortex and cerebellum in the central nervous system It is also expressed in adrenal gland, placenta, testis, spleen, gut, thymus and skin . CRH is the principal mediator of endocrine stress response . CRH also plays a significant role in inflammatory responses , hemodynamic actions , stromal cell decidualization during estrus cycle , implantation of blastocyst , maintenance of pregnancy, onset of labor  and neuroprotection . Excess secretion of CRH during severe depression and its association with increased levels of cortisol have been observed . CRH has also been reported to be involved in anxiety disorders , anorexia nervosa . Decrease in cortical CRH content has been observed in Alzheimer’s disease  and Parkinson’s disease .  The actions of CRH are mediated through class II/secretin-like family type of G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) called the CRH receptors (CRHR) . CRH is a high affinity ligand of CRHR1 and also binds to CRHR2 but with lower affinity . CRH receptors do not have any intrinsic kinase activity and transduce the signal via the heterotrimeric G-proteins . The CRH receptors are rapidly desensitized by G-protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) and β-arrestin mechanisms in the presence of high concentrations of CRH . Binding of CRH to CRH receptor induces a conformational change in the receptor by activating it. This further activates Gα-subunit and its subsequent dissociation from the Gβγ dimer. CRH receptors on interaction with Gα-subunit of different G-proteins such as Gαs, Gαi/o, Gαq/11 activate numerous downstream signaling cascades and result in the induction of various cellular responses . The pathways that are activated upon CRH stimulation are: Adenylate cyclase/cAMP/PKA, PLC/PKC, ERK/MAPK, PI3K-AKT and NF-kappa B.   CRH binding to CRHR1 couples G-stimulatory (Gs) protein which in turn activates cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Activation of PKA leads to the phosphorylation of transcription factors like cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), which in turn increases the expression of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) gene and the release of POMC-derived peptides, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and β-endorphin. ACTH, in turn, stimulates the secretion of glucocorticoids from adrenal glands and thereby mediates changes associated with stress response . CREB also regulates genes containing the Ca2+/cAMP response element such as FOS . The activation of cAMP by CRH induces the mRNA expression and transcription of orphan nuclear receptors NR4A1 and NR4A2, which in turn transcriptionally activates the expression of POMC . Activation of cAMP/PKA can also induce the expression of enzymes involved in dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and cortisol production . The biological functions of CRH are also mediated by MAPK family, in particular MAPK1/3 and MAPK14. MAPK1/3 mediates activation of transcription factors NR4A1 and NR4A2 and induction of POMC in corticotrophs . MAPK14 is involved in CRH-induced inhibition of IL-18 expression in human keratinocytes . The CRHR1/PKA/ERK signaling activate the transcription factors - ELK1 , SP1 and TFAP2A. SP1 and TFAP2A up-regulates the expression of ADRBK2, which causes the desensitization of CRHR1 receptors .  The PLC/PKC pathway is activated by coupling of the CRH receptors to the Gαq/11 proteins. This cascade stimulates the formation of IP3 and contributes to the mobilization of intracellular calcium. Calcium is involved in the transcription regulation of FOS as well as NR4A1 and NR4A2 through CAMK2A. PLC/PKC is involved in the activation of AP-1 complex and subsequent transcriptional regulation of genes involved in keratinocyte differentiation and proliferation – KRT1, KRT14 and IVL . This cascade also inhibits the expression of CYP11A1 and HSD3B1, the genes involved in progesterone synthesis in placental trophoblasts .  Another important signaling pathway activated upon CRH stimulation is the nitric oxide (NO)/cGMP, involved in the control of vascular tone . In human keratinocytes, upon CRH stimulation, NFKBIA degradation is diminished and the activity of NFKB is inhibited resulting in the down-regulation of NFKB-dependant genes IL2 and HSP90AA1 and inhibition of cell proliferation . The gene involved in cell survival, BCL2 is transcriptionally regulated via the PI3K/AKT .  Please access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/CRH_pathway.html NetSlim] database.

AhR is a member of basic helix-loop-helix-Per-Arnt-Sim (bHLH-PAS) superfamily of transcription factors. In the absence of ligand, the AhR can be found in the cytosol, bound to a dimer of the heat shock protein of 90 kDa (Hsp90) and the immunophilin-like protein, AIP (also known as XAP2 and ARA9). Upon ligand binding, the AHR translocates to the nucleus and binds with ARNT. The AHR/ARNT heterodimer binds to xenobiotic response elements and regulates a diverse set of genes 	CCL1	E2F1	ERK1	HRAS	CYP1B1	A	HSP90	CDC37	P23	ARNT	AIP	SRC-1	AHRR	KRAS	ZAC1	COX-2	VEGF	EGFR	NF-1	KLF6	RET	CYP1A1	MAP2K1	EBNA-3	NCOA7	RAF1	CYP1A2	ERAP140	AHR	CDK2	2	NRAS	CD36	ER	RIP140	SMRT

Hs_IL-4_Signaling_Pathway_WP395_74009.gpml	IL-4 Signaling Pathway|IL-4 is a glycoprotein which is composed of 129 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 20kDa. IL-4 and IL-13 are produced by CD4+ cells and exhibit significant functional overlap. Both these cytokines play a critical role in the promotion of allergic responses. IL-4 is primarily involved in promoting the differentiation and proliferation of T helper 2 (TH2) cells and the synthesis of immunoglobulin E (IgE). Apart from its role in allergic responses including asthma, IL-4 was also found to regulate retinal progenitor proliferation, rod photoreceptor differentiation, cholinergic and GABAergic amacrine differentiation and neuroprotection and survival. IL-4 was also found to have regulatory effects in a number of neurological diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Multiple sclerosis, Experimental autoimmune encephelitis. It was also found to relieve inflammatory and neuropathic pain. IL-4 is capable of exerting its biological activities through interaction with two cell surface receptor complexes - Type I IL4 receptor and Type II IL4 Receptor. Both these receptor complexes comprise of a common IL4Rα (CD124) subunit, which is also the functional receptor chain. Type I IL-4 receptor is formed by the interaction of IL4Rα subunit with IL-2γc (CD132). Type II IL-4 receptor is formed by the interaction of IL-4Rα subunit with IL-13Rα. Interaction of IL-4 with its receptor results in receptor dimerization and activation. The Type I receptors activates JAK1 and 3, which are associated with the receptor subunits. The activated JAK phosphorylates tyrosine residues the cytoplasmic tails of the receptor which then serves as docking sites for a number of adaptor or signaling molecules including STAT6. Activated STAT6 dimerizes, translocated to the nucleus and transcriptionally actives genes responsive to IL-4. Many of the key functions of IL4 allergic disorders, including TH2 cell differentiation, airway hyper responsiveness, mucus cell metaplasia and IgE synthesis are dependent on STAT6 activation. Other phosphorylated tyrosine residue bind to proteins with phospho-tyrosine binding (PTB) motifs including IRS proteins. This results in the phosphorylation of the IRS proteins, which can then potentially activate the PI3K/AKT cascade by binding to the p85 subunit of PI3K or the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade. The PI3K/AKT pathway is thought to mediate the growth and survival signals in multiple IL-4 responsive cell types including T- and B- lymphocytes and natural killer cells.

Hs_Androgen_receptor_signaling_pathway_WP138_72130.gpml	Androgen receptor signaling pathway|Androgens, mainly testosterone and 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) play significant role in the growth and development of the male reproductive organs. These steroid hormones bring about their biological functions through their associations with Androgen receptor (AR), a 110 KDa ligand dependent transcription factor that falls under the group of nuclear receptor superfamily. DHT binds the receptor with high affinity compared to testosterone. The AR gene is located in the X chromosome at Xq11-12 site. AR is cytosolic protein, which in the ligand unbound state, is present as a complex with various Heat shock proteins primarily Hsp70, 90 and 56 as well as p23. Upon ligand binding, it dissociates from the complex. AR is found to be expressed in a number of tissues and cells including prostate, testis, seminal vescicle, epididymis, skin, skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, liver and central nervous system. The protein has four functional domains- an N terminal domain (NTD), a DNA binding domain (DBD), a hinge region and a Ligand binding Domain (LBD). The DBD is a 658 amino acid residue region that has ZNF motifs which allows it bind to DNA. The rest of the domains are involved in dimerization and ligand binding. Two phosphorylation events are proposed to play very important role in the activation of the receptor upon ligand binding. The first phosphorylation event releases the ligand binding domain for hormone binding. The subsequent phosphorylation event is triggered upon hormone binding. Activated AR upon ligand binding undergoes conformational change to form a homodimer and interacts tightly with the Androgen Response Element (ARE). The androgen receptor is known to bind to many co-regulators at different time points and in different cell types. This DNA protein complex triggers the expression of various target genes that are associated with the male phenotype. Modulation of the AR activity is carried out by several transcription factors like ARA70, TR4, SRC family members and CBP/p300 and other associated proteins. FXXLF and WXXLF motifs containing coactivators such as the p160 members bind with the AF2 region of the Ligand Binding Domain of the AR. Androgen receptors are known to induce apoptosis under certain conditions. Various regulators that regulate androgen induced apoptosis include BRCA1 and Smad3 and Akt. Mutation in AR are also known to be associated in a number of diseases including spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) or Kennedy's disease and Androgen Insensitivity syndrome (AIS). Abnormal amplification of the androgen gene as well as deregulation of AR gene expression have been shown to be associated with prostate cancer.

Hs_Notch_Signaling_Pathway_WP268_70096.gpml	Notch Signaling Pathway|The Notch signaling pathway is an evolutionarily conserved, intercellular signaling mechanism essential for proper embryonic development in all metazoan organisms in the Animal kingdom. The Notch proteins (Notch1-Notch4 in vertebrates) are single-pass receptors that are activated by the Delta (or Delta-like) and Jagged/Serrate families of membrane-bound ligands. They are transported to the plasma membrane as cleaved, but otherwise intact polypeptides. Interaction with ligand leads to two additional proteolytic cleavages that liberate the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) from the plasma membrane. The NICD translocates to the nucleus, where it forms a complex with the DNA binding protein CSL, displacing a histone deacetylase (HDAc)-co-repressor (CoR) complex from CSL. Components of an activation complex, such as MAML1 and histone acetyltransferases (HATs), are recruited to the NICD-CSL complex, leading to the transcriptional activation of Notch target genes.

Hs_Catalytic_cycle_of_mammalian_FMOs_WP688_63157.gpml	Catalytic cycle of mammalian FMOs|Flavin-containing monooxygenases are a group of enzymes that catalyze the oxygenation of substrates, mostly soft nucleophiles via the cofactor flavin. In the catalytic cycle, FMO binds to NADPH and to FAD, causing the reduction of FAD to FADH2. Next, molecular oxygen binds to the complex and is reduced to a hydroperoxide form, called 4a-hydroperoxyflavin. This complex is stable in the absence of a substrate. When a substrate is present, the distal O-atom of the complex is transferred to the substrate yielding an oxygenated product and leaving the flavincomplex 4a-hydroxyflavin that breaks down releasing water. At the end of the cycle, NADP+ is released resulting in FAD as the flavin form to start a next cycle.   In contrast to cytochrome P450 enzymes, FMOs are generally not induced or inhibited by xenobiotic substances. The five human FMOs are tissue specific: FMO1 is present in the human fetal liver and the adult kidney, FMO2 is present in the lung and FMO3 is present in the adult liver.	FMO4	FMO5	FMO1	FMO2	FMO3

Hs_Interleukin-11_Signaling_Pathway_WP2332_71360.gpml	Interleukin-11 Signaling Pathway|IL-11 is a multifunctional cytokine that belongs to the gp130 family. It was first isolated from a primate bone marrow derived cell line, PU-34 for its ability to stimulate the proliferation of a plasmacytoma cell line, T1165 which was dependent on IL-6. This cytokine plays an important role in the synthesis, maturation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells. It  also plays significant role in the inhibition of adipocyte differentiation, regulation of trophoblasts invasion and placentation in humans.   The receptor for IL-11 is IL11RA that uses the common gp130 receptor subunit for signal transduction. The pathways that are activated upon IL-11 stimulation are JAK-STAT, Ras-MAPK, PI3K-AKT and NF-kappa B/p65. Binding of IL-11 with IL-11RA results in the heterodimerization, tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of gp130. The activated IL11RA-gp130 receptor complex further activates Jak family of tyrosine kinases, JAK1 and JAK2. Phosphorylated JAK2 then activates STAT3 and STAT1 that results in their subsequent translocation into the nucleus. The translocated STAT3 then induces the transcription of genes associated with endometrial cell adhesion, gastric inflammation and differentiation of periodontal ligament cells. The activation of STAT3 was shown to be inhibited by the overexpression of Suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS3). IL-11 signalling through JAK2/STAT3 has been shown to be crucial for normal placentation in humans and normal development of craniofacial bones and teeth in mice.  In addition to JAK-STAT, IL-11 also activate the Ras-MAPK, PI3K-AKT and NF-kappa B pathways. In response to IL-11, GTP loaded Ras interacts with RAF1 and leads to autophosphorylation of RAF1. Activation of RAF1 leads to the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) through MEK1 and MEK2. Activation of phospholipase D was triggered by IL-11 leading to the formation of phosphatidic acid, which has also been shown to activate the MAPKs. Transcription factors, ATF1 and CREB1 were activated by these phosphorylated MAPKs through p90 S6 kinase. PI3K-AKT and NF-kappa B/p65 pathways stimulated by IL-11 have been shown to enhance the migration and proliferation of chondrosarcoma cells. In CD4+ T cells, Th2 polarization was induced by IL-11 through NF-kappa B inhibition. SRC, FYN and YES, members of Src family of tyrosine kinases were also activated in response to IL-11 signalling.

Hs_Focal_Adhesion_WP306_71714.gpml	Focal Adhesion|Cell-matrix adhesions play essential roles in important biological processes including cell motility, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, regulation of gene expression and cell survival. At the cell-extracellular matrix contact points, specialized structures are formed and termed focal adhesions, where bundles of actin filaments are anchored to transmembrane receptors of the integrin family through a multi-molecular complex of junctional plaque proteins. Some of the constituents of focal adhesions participate in the structural link between membrane receptors and the actin cytoskeleton, while others are signalling molecules, including different protein kinases and phosphatases, their substrates, and various adapter proteins. Integrin signaling is dependent upon the non-receptor tyrosine kinase activities of the FAK and src proteins as well as the adaptor protein functions of FAK, src and Shc to initiate downstream signaling events. These signalling events culminate in reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton; a prerequisite for changes in cell shape and motility, and gene expression. Similar morphological alterations and modulation of gene expression are initiated by the binding of growth factors to their respective receptors, emphasizing the considerable crosstalk between adhesion- and growth factor-mediated signalling.

Hs_Heme_Biosynthesis_WP561_72035.gpml	Heme Biosynthesis|The enzymatic process that produces heme is properly called porphyrin synthesis, as all the intermediates are tetrapyrroles that are chemically classified are porphyrins. The process is highly conserved across biology. In humans, this pathway serves almost exclusively to form heme. In other species, it also produces similar substances such as cobalamin (vitamin B12).  The pathway is initiated by the synthesis of D-Aminolevulinic acid (dALA or Î´ALA) from the amino acid glycine and succinyl-CoA from the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle). The rate-limiting enzyme responsible for this reaction, ALA synthase, is strictly regulated by intracellular iron levels and heme concentration. A low-iron level, e.g., in iron deficiency, leads to decreased porphyrin synthesis, which prevents accumulation of the toxic intermediates. This mechanism is of therapeutic importance: infusion of heme arginate or hematin can abort attacks of porphyria in patients with an inborn error of metabolism of this process, by reducing transcription of ALA synthase.  The organs mainly involved in heme synthesis are the liver and the bone marrow, although every cell requires heme to function properly. Heme is seen as an intermediate molecule in catabolism of haemoglobin in the process of bilirubin metabolism.

For the ATM pathway these are TP53 and CHEK2, while CHEK1 is most important for the ATR pathway. The goal of this first pathway is to provide an overview of the most important gene products, processes and changes in cell condition elicited by the DNA damage response while keeping it clear and understandable. Also some microRNAs are implemented to visualize the possible effects they can induce. By doing so a better understanding of the role microRNA play in the DNA damage response might arise.

Two types of estrogen receptor exist: ER which is a member of the nuclear hormone family of intracellular receptors and the estrogen G protein coupled receptor GPR30 (GPER), which is a G-protein coupled receptor. The main function of the estrogen receptor is as a DNA binding transcription factor which regulates gene expression. However the estrogen receptor also has additional functions independent of DNA binding.

Hs_B_Cell_Receptor_Signaling_Pathway_WP23_72101.gpml	B Cell Receptor Signaling Pathway|The functional B-cell receptor is a multi-protein complex consisting of an antigen binding subunit and a signaling subunit. The antigen binding subunit is the membrane bound immunoglobulin and the signaling subunit consists of the IgŒ± and IgŒ≤ proteins, which are covalently bound to each other. Both IgŒ± and IgŒ≤ proteins have an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based activation motif (ITAM) each in its cytoplasmic region, which is responsible for the initiation and propagation of signaling. Antigen binding to the immunoglubulin results in the aggregation of both the immunoglobulin and the IgŒ±/Œ≤ subunits. This results in the phosphorylation of the tyrosine residues in the ITAM motif of the IgŒ±/Œ≤ subunits by the src-family of protein tyrosine kinases Lyn and Syk. The Src family kinases are initially in the proximity of the BCR as a result of membrane anchoring by virtue of its their acetylation. The N-terminal region of the kinases can also interact with the non-phosphorylated ITAMs of IgŒ±. This association is further enhanced upon BCR engagement as a result of accumulation in BCR containing lipid rafts and SH2 domain mediated binding to the phosphorylated tyrosine residues in ITAMs. This increased association helps in amplifying the BCR mediated signaling. Doubly phosphorylated IgŒ±/Œ≤ ITAMs are necessary for efficient recruitment of Syk and its activation. Activated Syk then phsophorylates the adapter molecule B cell linker protein (BLNK), which acts as molecular scaffold for the recruitment of multiple effectors and hence the propagation of multiple signaling pathways. BLNK binds to Btk and PLCŒ≥2 which results in optimal phosphorylation and activation of PLC. This is an important mechanism which links BCR to Ca2+ signaling. Apart from the PLC mediated Ca2+ signaling, BCR triggering also results in the the activaion of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3K). This activation takes place through the recruitment of p85 adaptor subunit of PI-3K to CD19 co-receptor, which is phosphorylated by Lyn on its cytoplasmic Y-X-X-M motif. Alternatively, PI-3K can be recruited to the plasma membrane by other adapter molecules including PIK3AP, CBL or GAB1/2. PI-3K catalyzes the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to phosphatidyl inositol 3,4,5-bisphosphate. Akt, a serine threonine kinase, is recruited to the plasma membrane by virtue of its N-terminal PH-domain where it is activated by conformational changes and phosphorylation. Activated Akt phosphorylates several substrates resulting in diverse physiological consequences: Forkhead transcription factors - resulting in its degradation and hence inhibition of expression of pro-apoptotic genes, glycogen synthase kinase-3 GSK3 -leading to its inhibition and hence regulation of cell-cycle. The tanscription factor NF-kappaB is also found to be activated in BCR signaling in a Btk, PI-3K and PKC dependent manner.  BCR engagement can also result in the association of GRB2/SOS complex with either SHC or BLNK, which results in the activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade. This cascade leads to the activation of transcription factors including ELK and MYC. BCR activation also results in the activation of JNKs and p38MAPK.

Hs_Leptin_signaling_pathway_WP2034_71413.gpml	Leptin signaling pathway|Leptin is a peptide hormone mainly synthesised and secreted from adipocytes. It is also expressed in other tissues including placenta, stomach and skeletal muscle. Leptin mediates its effects by binding to its receptor, leptin receptor (LEPR). LEPR belongs to gp130 family of cytokine receptor. LEPR is expressed in many tissues such as brain, adipose tissue, heart, placenta, lung and liver. Alternative splicing of LEPR results in six different isoforms, LEPRa, LEPRb, LEPRc, LEPRd, LEPRe and LEPRf. LEPRb is the longest isoform and possess signaling capacity. The role of other isoforms in leptin signaling is not clear. Leptin plays a major role in the regulation of energy homeostasis and regulate food intake and energy expenditure. Leptin is found to be transported to various regions of the brain across blood brain barrier. Impairment in leptin signaling across the blood brain barrier induces leptin resistance and thus obesity. Leptin is known to regulate reproduction, bone homeostasis and immune signaling. Leptin is also implicated in various physiological processers such as angiogenesis and hematopoiesis. LEPRb forms a homodimer and binds to leptin in 1:1 stoichiometry. This tetrameric receptor/ ligand complex appears to be essential for signaling. Leptin receptor lacks intrinsic kinase activity. It mediates multiple signaling pathways by binding to cytoplasmic kinases such as Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2). Activation of JAK2 by leptin promotes the tyrosine phosphorylation of LEPRb at Tyr-986, Try-1078 and Tyr-1141, thus activating LEPRb. Activation of leptin receptor with leptin activates signaling modules such as JAK/STAT, RAS/RAF/MAPK, IRS1/PI-3K, PLCγ and AMPK/ACC modules. Tyrosine phosphorylation of LEPRb induces binding of STATs to LEPRb. Binding of STATs to the phosphorylated residues of LEPR leads to the JAK2 mediated tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of STATs. Activated STATs translocate to the nucleus and induces expression of genes such as suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) and TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 1 (TIMP1). SOCS3 mediates feedback inhibition of leptin pathway by binding to Tyr-986 residue of LEPR. Cytosolic PTP1B also negatively regulates leptin pathway by dephosphorylating JAK2 and STAT3. Binding of leptin to its receptor results in the phosphorylation of PTPN1. Phosphorylated PTPN11 provides a docking site for GRB2, resulting in the activation of ERK module through RAS-RAF-MEK signaling. Leptin induces the activation of PI-3K by promoting the interaction and formation of SH2B/JAK2/IRS complex. Activation PI-3K mediates the activation of activation of protein kinases such as protein kinase B (AKT1) and downstream signaling cascades such as mammalian target of rapamycin (MTOR), nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3) and phosphodiesterase 3A, cGMP-inhibited (PDE3A). Activated AKT also regulates glycogen synthase kinase 3 alpha/beta (GSK3A/B) proteins. IkappaB kinases (IKKs) are activated in response to AKT activation. Activated IKKs induce nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. Leptin also regulates 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling. AMPK function as energy sensor and is activated in response to rise in AMP to ATP ratio. Activated AMPK regulate fatty acid biosymthesis by regulating the activity the enzyme, fatty acid biosynthesis-acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). PLC gamma is activated in response to leptin signaling. Activated PLC gamma regulate intracellular calcium levels and also protein kinase C activation by hydrolysing phospholipid phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG).

It culminates in the formation of thrombin, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of soluble fibrinogen to the insoluble fibrin clot. The kallikrein-kinin system is an endogenous metabolic cascade, triggering of which results in the release of vasoactive kinins (bradykinin-related peptides). Kinin peptides are implicated in many physiological and pathological processes including the regulation of blood pressure and sodium homeostasis, inflammatory processes, and the cardioprotective effects of preconditioning. Complement is a system of plasma proteins that is activated by the presence of pathogens. There are three pathways of complement activation: the classical pathway, the lectin pathway, and the alternative pathway. All of these pathways generate a crucial enzymatic activity that, intern, generates the effector molecules of complement.

Hs_Nicotine_Metabolism_WP1600_70113.gpml	Nicotine Metabolism|  This pathway shows metabolism of nicotine in human liver including all the candidate genes which may be responsible. Nicotine is extensively metabolized to a number of metabolites in liver. Quantitatively, the most important metabolite of nicotine in most mammalian species is cotinine. In humans, about 70 to 80% of nicotine is converted to cotinine. This transformation involves two steps. The first is mediated by the cytochrome P450 system (mainly CYP2A6 and CYP2B6) to produce nicotine iminium ion. Both of these genes have polymorphisms that can effect this process, for more details see VIP gene information for CYP2A6 and CYP2B6. The second step is catalyzed by aldehyde oxidase (AOX). Nicotine N'-oxide (NNO) is another primary metabolite of nicotine, although only about 4-7% of nicotine absorbed by smokers is metabolized via this route. The conversion of nicotine to NNO involves a flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3). It appears that NNO is not further metabolized to any significant extent, except by reduction back to nicotine, which may lead to recycling of nicotine in the body. Nicotine glucuronidation results in an N-quaternary glucuronide in humans. This reaction is catalyzed by uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzyme(s) producing (S)-nicotine-N-Â¿-glucuronide (Nicotine-Gluc). Recent in vitro experiments suggest that UGT2B10 may be the primary enzyme in liver responsible for this conversion and that gene polymorphisms may influence this. About 3-5% of nicotine is converted to Nicotine-Gluc and excreted in urine in humans. Conversion of nicotine to nornicotine in humans has been demonstrated, and this process has been shown to be mediated by cytochrome P450 system in rabbits.  A number of cotinine metabolites have also been structurally characterized. Indeed, it appears that most of the reported urinary metabolites of nicotine are derived from cotinine. 3'-Hydroxycotinine (3HC) is the main nicotine metabolite detected in smokers' urine. It is also excreted as a glucuronide conjugate (3HC-Gluc). 3HC and 3HC-Gluc account for 40-60% of the nicotine dose in urine. As with NNO, cotinine N-oxide (CNO) can be reduced back to the parent amine in vivo as evidenced by a study in rabbits. Studies with CYP enzyme inhibitors in hamster and guinea pig liver microsomes show, that unlike NNO, CNO is formed by CYP enzymes. Norcotinine has been detected in smokers' urine (about 1% of total nicotine and metabolites). Two pathways for its formation are possible, demethylation of cotinine or oxidative metabolism of nornicotine. Animal and human studies have demonstrated the existence of both of these pathways.  There are additional important metabolites of nicotine that are not formed to any great extent endogenously as shown by experiments with nicotine patches as the drug delivery method, but are formed during the tobacco smoking process. The most well characterized as carcinogens so far are NNK (4-(methylnitrosamino)1(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone) and NNAL (4-(methylnitrosamino)1(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol). Although not depicted here these carcinogens are also metabolized by some of the same enzymes that metabolise nicotine including CYP2A6, UGT2B10, UGT1A4 and CYP2A13.

Hs_One_Carbon_Metabolism_WP241_68025.gpml	One Carbon Metabolism|This one-carbon metabolism pathway is centered around folate. Folate has two key carbon-carbon double bonds. Saturating one of them yields dihydrofolate (DHF) and adding an additional molecule of hydrogen across the second yields tetrahydrofolate (THF). Folates serve as donors of single carbons in any one of three oxidation states: 5-methyl-THF (CH3THF; reduced), 5,10 methylene-THF (CH2THF; intermediate) and 10-formyl-THF (CHOTHF; oxidized). The single carbon donor CH3THF is used to convert homocysteine into methionine which can then be used to methylate DNA, the donor CH2THF is used (along with a molecule of hydrogen at the site of one of the double bonds) to convert dUMP (deoxyuridylate) into dTMP (thymidylate) and the donor CHOTHF is used to set up ring closure reactions in de novo purine synthesis. CH3THF is the primary methyl-group donor for processes such as DNA methylation reactions. Purines are used both in RNA synthesis and in DNA synthesis and dTMP is synthesized srtictly for DNA synthesis, be it for DNA repair or DNA replication. The folate pathway is central to any study related to DNA methylation, dTMP synthesis or purine synthesis.  Differential methylation (e.g. hypermethylation of tumor suppressors) as well as disturbances in nucleotide synthesis and repair, are associated with several forms of cancer. There are also indications that hypermethylation is involved in the progression of adenomas to cancer.   The pathway is also illustrative of the role of a number of B vitamins, including vitamin B12 (cobalamine) which is important for the sythesis of folate (vitamin B9) and of methionine.

Hs_IL-7_Signaling_Pathway_WP205_70018.gpml	IL-7 Signaling Pathway|Interleukin-7 (IL-7) was discovered in the year 1988 as a factor that enhanced the growth of murine B-cell precursors in bone marrow culture system. It was also known as lymphopoietin 1and pre-B cell factor. IL-7 plays an important role in the development of B and T cells in mouse and T cells in humans. It is also essential for mature and naive T-cell’s survival and proliferation. Human IL-7 gene maps to chromosome 8 and is about 72kb in length. The protein encoded by this gene is 177 amino acids in length with a molecular weight of 20 kDa. The active form of IL-7 in humans is a glycoprotein of 25 kDa. In humans IL-7 has been shown to be produced from intestinal epithelial cells, keratinocytes , hepatic tissues, peripheral blood dendritic cells, follicular dendritic cells, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts. The IL-7 receptor consists of IL-7 receptor alpha chain (IL-7Rα) and a common gamma chain (γc). The gamma chain is also shared by IL-2, IL-4, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21 receptors. The signaling pathways activated upon IL-7 binding to the receptor complex are JAK-STAT, PI-3 kinase and Src kinase pathways. JAK3, a protein tyrosine kinase is constitutively associated with the carboxy-terminal region of the gamma chain. Studies in mice lacking JAK3 have shown that it is required for transducing γc dependent signals. Mutations in JAK3 and γc have been shown to be associated with the autosomal recessive form of T-B + SCID. JAK1, another protein tyrosine kinase is associated with IL-7Rα chain and is activated upon IL-7 binding. JAK1 deficient mice shows severely impaired thymic development and no hematopoietic colony formation in response to IL-7. IL-7 would first bind to IL-7Rα and then associates with the gamma chain, bringing their intracellular domains bearing JAK1 and JAK3 together. JAK3 phosphorylates IL-7Rα chain creating docking sites for the transcription factors, STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5. JAK1 and JAK3 phosphorylate these STAT molecules and induces their dimerization and translocation to the nucleus where they activate specific target genes. PTK2B, a protein tyrosine kinase has been shown to be associated with JAK1 and plays an important role in the survival of thymocyte cell line. The enzymatic activity and its phosphorylation are highly induced by IL-7. PI-3 kinase pathway is also activated by IL-7 and this pathway is essential for the survival and proliferation of human T cell precursors. PI-3 kinase interacts with IL-7Rα upon IL-7 stimulation and activates its downstream target, AKT and its activation is mediated by γc. AKT in turn activates GSK3 beta and Bad, the death protein. Survival of pro T-cell survival by regulating Bad via PI3 kinase/AKT pathway is mediated by IL-7. IL-7 also mediates the downregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B through the PI-3 kinase pathway and this effect is required for cell proliferation. IL-7 also induces the phosphorylation of a Src kinase family member, Fyn which is constitutively associated with IL7RA. In addition, IL-7 induces phosphorylation of MAPK family members including MAPK1 and MAPK3.  Please access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/IL_7_pathway.html NetSlim] database.

Hs_Glucuronidation_WP698_63198.gpml	Glucuronidation|Metabolism of xenobiotic compounds consists of phase I and a phase II biotransformation reactions, being compound modification and conjugation reactions respectively. In phase I biotransformation, the compound is modificated via oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, or other minor reactions, to reveal a reactive group to which a conjugation molecule can react to. In phase II, a small conjugation molecule reacts with the phase I modified molecule, producing a much more water-soluble molecule that can be excreted more easily. Glucuronidation is a phase II biotransformation reaction in which glucuronide acts as a conjugation molecule and binds to a substrate via the catalysis of glucuronosyltransferases. First, in a series of reactions the cosubstrate uridine diphosphate glucuronic acid (UDPGA) is formed. The glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) then catalyze the transfer of glucuronic acid from UDPGA to a substrate resulting in a glucuronidated substrate and leaving uridine 5'-diphosphate. UGTs are a very broad and divers group of enzymes and count as the most significant  group of conjugation enzymes in xenobiotic metabolism, qualitatively because glucuronic acid can be coupled to a large diversity of functional groups and quantitatively because of the large and divers number of substrates that are formed.

Hs_PDGF_Pathway_WP2526_72247.gpml	PDGF Pathway|PDGF belongs to the PDGF/VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) family, which is characterized by eight strictly conserved cysteine residues with similar spacing in between (Joukov et al., 1997; Heldin and Westermark, 1999). The A-, B-, C-, and D-chain genes of PDGF are localized to the chromosomes 7p22, 22q13, 4q31, and 11q22, respectively, and their expression is independently regulated.

Hs_Parkinsons_Disease_Pathway_WP2371_71267.gpml	Parkinsons Disease Pathway|Most people with Parkinson's disease have idiopathic Parkinson's disease (having no specific known cause). A small proportion of cases, however, can be attributed to known genetic factors. Mutations in specific genes have been conclusively shown to cause PD. These genes code for alpha-synuclein (SNCA), parkin (PRKN), leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2 or dardarin), PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1), DJ-1 and ATP13A2.[4][22] In most cases, people with these mutations will develop PD. With the exception of LRRK2, however, they account for only a small minority of cases of PD.[4] The most extensively studied PD-related genes are SNCA and LRRK2. Mutations in genes including SNCA, LRRK2 and glucocerebrosidase (GBA) have been found to be risk factors for sporadic PD. The role of the SNCA gene is important in PD because the alpha-synuclein protein is the main component of Lewy bodies.[22] Missense mutations of the gene (in which a single nucleotide is changed), and duplications and triplications of the locus containing it have been found in different groups with familial PD. Mutations in LRRK2 are the most common known cause of familial and sporadic PD, accounting for approximately 5% of individuals with a family history of the disease and 3% of sporadic cases.

Hs_Nicotine_Activity_on_Dopaminergic_Neurons_WP1602_69773.gpml	Nicotine Activity on Dopaminergic Neurons|  Nicotine is an alkaloid found in tobacco plants. It is a substance that acts as a stimulant in humans and is one of the main factors responsible for tobacco dependence. When nicotine enters the body, it is distributed quickly through the bloodstream, and it can cross the blood-brain barrier to enter the central nervous system (CNS). It binds to two main types of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors: the ganglion type and the CNS type.  In dopaminergic neurons in the CNS, nicotine binds to the CNS-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. The main type of CNS receptor is composed of alpha 4 beta 2 (CHRNA4, CHRNB2) subunits. It has been shown that alpha 6, alpha 5, and beta 3 can also be in the receptor complex to modulate binding sensitivity. By binding to the receptor, nicotine causes cell depolarization and release of dopamine from the cell through the SNARE complex. Dopamine then binds to dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) on dopaminergic terminals and activates Gi alpha (GNAI1), initiating a feedback loop to inhibit dopamine release. One of the key players mediating dopamine signaling is PPP1R1B (also called DARPP-32, dopamine and cyclic AMP-regulated phospho-protein). PPP1R1B is a bifunctional signal transduction molecule which, by distinct mechanisms, inhibits either a serine/threonine kinase (PPKACA or PKA) or a serine/threonine phosphatase (PPP1CA or protein phosphatase 1). When PPP1R1B is phosphorylated by PPKACA at threonine 34, it is an inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 (PPP1CA), which inhibits dopamine secretion through the SNARE complex. When PPP1R1B is phosphorylated by CDK5 at threonine 75, it is converted to an inhibitor of PPKACA. Binding of dopamine to D2-like dopamine receptors leads to inhibition of adenylate cyclase (ADCY2) via G-protein GNAI1, and decreases PKA-stimulated phosphorylation of DARPP-32 at Thr34. This, in turn, relieves the inhibition of protein phosphatase 1 (PPP1CA), and inhibits further dopamine release.

Hs_Eukaryotic_Transcription_Initiation_WP405_73594.gpml	Eukaryotic Transcription Initiation|In eukaryotes, RNA polymerase, and therefore the initiation of transcription, requires the presence of a core promoter sequence in the DNA. RNA polymerase is able to bind to core promoters in the presence of various specific transcription factors. The most common type of core promoter in eukaryotes is a short DNA sequence known as a TATA box. The TATA box, as a core promoter, is the binding site for a transcription factor known as TATA binding protein (TBP), which is itself a subunit of another transcription factor, called Transcription Factor II D (TFIID). After TFIID binds to the TATA box via the TBP, five more transcription factors and RNA polymerase combine around the TATA box in a series of stages to form a preinitiation complex. One transcription factor, DNA helicase, has helicase activity and so is involved in the separating of opposing strands of double-stranded DNA to provide access to a single-stranded DNA template. However, only a low, or basal, rate of transcription is driven by the preinitiation complex alone. Other proteins known as activators and repressors, along with any associated coactivators or corepressors, are responsible for modulating transcription rate.

FSH controls the growth and maturation of follicles in the females and spermatogenesis in males. FSH is a heterodimer and shares a common alpha sub-unit with the other glycoprotein hormones in its family and has a specific beta subunit that confers receptor specificity and biological activity to the hormone. FSH acts through the FSH receptor (FSHR), a G protein coupled receptor  that is expressed exclusively on the granulosa cells of ovaries and Sertoli cells of the testis  in humans. FSH signaling involves activation of adenylyl cyclase activity and the increased production of cAMP. This activates the cAMP dependent protein kinases such as PKA, PKB and PKC that, in turn, lead to the phosphorylation of specific transcription factors such as cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and Forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1). In addition to activation of PI3K/Akt module, PKA also induces p38 mapk which, in turn, controls other kinase cascades. Activated Akt also induces the mTOR axis that stimulates mRNA translation by phosphorylating p70 S6 kinase and, consequently, the 40 S ribosomal protein S6 that results in the activation of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4E. It also indirectly aids in the activation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERKs). FSH induces important genes required for steroidogenesis as well as growth and maturation of germ cells. The important target genes include aromatase (CYP19A1), the lutenizing hormone receptor (LHR) and the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).

The p53-dependent responses inhibit CDKs through the up-regulation of genes encoding CKIs mediated by the p53 protein, whereas the p53-independent mechanisms inhibit CDKs through the inhibitory T14Y15 phosphorylation of Cdk2. Failure of DNA damage checkpoints in G1 leads to mutagenic replication of damaged templates and other replication defects.

Hs_mRNA_Processing_WP411_71369.gpml	mRNA Processing|This process describes the conversion of precursor messenger RNA into mature messenger RNA (mRNA).  The pre-mRNA molecule undergoes three main modifications. These modifications are 5' capping, 3' polyadenylation, and RNA splicing, which occur in the cell nucleus before the RNA is translated.  5' Capping: Capping of the pre-mRNA involves the addition of 7-methylguanosine (m7G) to the 5' end. The cap protects the 5' end of the primary RNA transcript from attack by ribonucleases that have specificity to the 3'5' phosphodiester bonds.  3' Processing: The pre-mRNA processing at the 3' end of the RNA molecule involves cleavage of its 3' end and then the addition of about 200 adenine residues to form a poly(A) tail. As the poly(A) tails is synthesised, it binds multiple copies of poly(A) binding protein, which protects the 3'end from ribonuclease digestion.  Splicing: RNA splicing is the process by which introns, regions of RNA that do not code for protein, are removed from the pre-mRNA and the remaining exons connected to re-form a single continuous molecule.

Hs_Alpha_6_Beta_4_signaling_pathway_WP244_72056.gpml	Alpha 6 Beta 4 signaling pathway|The integrin alpha6beta4 was discovered in the late 1980s by two different groups and was called either alphaEbeta4 or Ic-Ic binding protein (Ic-IcBP) (1,2). The alpha6beta4 integrin is a component of Hemidesmosomes (HDs) (3, 4,5). Increased expression of alphaEbeta4 and changes in its distribution is found to be correlated with increased aggressiveness of tumors and poor prognosis (6, 7). Although integrin alpha6beta4, can interact with different laminin isoforms, its preferred ligand in the epidermal BM is laminin-5 (8, 9). The beta4 integrin is a large protein and has a cytoplasmic domain of more than 1000 amino acids (10, 11). This domain contains a Na-Ca exchanger (CalX) motif followed by two pairs of type III fibronectin (FNIII) domains separated by a connecting segment (CS). It is found to associate with the intermediate filament system through plectin and BP230, which are components of hemidesmosomes (12,13,14). Interaction of intgrin beta4 with components of hemidesmosomes including plectin, BP230 and BP180 is found to be important in signaling events associated with cell growth, survival, and migration under physiological and pathological conditions.  Studies have shown that beta4 can regulate keratinocyte migration both positively and negatively (15,16,17,18). It is also found to regulate cell survival in keratinocytes in cell culture systems under stress in a PI3K/Akt pathway dependent manner (19,18). However, alpha6beta4 was not found to have any effect on keratinocyte survival in vivo (20, 18, 16). Apart from its effects on keratinocytes, evidence suggests that integrin alpha6beta4 is important in cancer cell invasion (21,22,23,24) and survival (25,26,27,28,16,29). The cancer cell invasion is regulated through a IRS/PI3K dependent process while the effect on carcinoma cell survival in a PI3K/Akt and dependent manner. Activation of the transcription factors NFkappaB and NF-IL6 in a p38Mapk dependent pathway and subsequent activation of IL6 gene expression was shown to be mechanism of alpha6beta4 induced survival of thymocytes and proliferation of thymic epithelial cells (27,30). Integrin alpha6beta4 is also known activate the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade which is found to be involved in the regulation of cell cycle (31,32,33,34).

Hs_Nuclear_Receptors_WP170_71083.gpml	Nuclear Receptors|Nuclear receptors are a class of proteins found within the interior of cells that are responsible for sensing the presence of steroid and thyroid hormones and certain other molecules. In response, these receptors work in concert with other proteins to regulate the expression of specific genes thereby controlling the development, homeostasis, and metabolism of the organism. Nuclear receptors have the ability to directly bind to DNA and regulate the expression of adjacent genes, hence these receptors are classified as transcription factors. The regulation of gene expression by nuclear receptors only happens when a liganda molecule which affects the receptor's behavioris present. More specifically, ligand binding to a nuclear receptor results in a conformational change in the receptor which in turn activates the receptor resulting in up-regulation of gene expression. A unique property of nuclear receptors which differentiate them from other classes of receptors is their ability to directly interact with and control the expression of genomic DNA. Consequently nuclear receptors play key roles in both embryonic development and adult homeostasis.

Hs_SRF_and_miRs_in_Smooth_Muscle_Differentiation_and_Proliferation_WP1991_74458.gpml	SRF and miRs in Smooth Muscle Differentiation and Proliferation|Smooth muscle cells exhibit a unique plasticity, in that they are able to oscillate between proliferative and more quiescent, differentiated states. These two states are determined, in part, by a network of transcription factors, including Klf-4, Elk-1 and serum response factor (SRF), that regulate expression of genes controlling smooth muscle cell status. Two smooth muscle-enriched, co-transcribed microRNAs (miRNAs), miR-143 and miR-145, cooperatively target this transcription factor network to promote smooth muscle cell differentiation. miR-145 also acts in a positive feed-foward regulatory loop to enhance expression of the smooth muscle regulator, Myocardin (Myocd), which cooperates with SRF to activate transcription of miR-143/145. Conversely, the cardiac and skeletal muscle-enriched miRNA, miR-133, which is also under transcriptional control of both SRF and Mef2C, acts in a negative feed-back loop to decrease SRF translation. Other miRNAs, including miR-214 and miR-199a, also target SRF, limiting its activity in specific cell types.

Hs_IL-6_signaling_pathway_WP364_73871.gpml	IL-6 signaling pathway|IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine with important role in immune regulation, hematopoiesis, inflammation and oncogenesis. IL-6-type cytokines exert their action via the signal transducer gp130 that associates with IL6R in a cooperative manner to form a hexameric signal transducing complex, capable of activating the down stream mediators of this signaling pathway. This mechanism of signal transduction is shared by other members of the IL-6 type cytokines like IL-11, leukaemia inhibitory factor, oncostatin M, ciliary neurotrophic factor and cardiotrophin-1 that use gp130 as a common subunit of the signal transducing complex. IL-6 stimulation leads to the activation of JAK/STAT pathway. Both STAT1 and STAT3 are phosphorylated and are able to form homo- and heterodimers after activation leading to their nuclear localization and subsequent regulation of transcription of respective target genes. SHP-2 is one of the ubiquitous tyrosine phosphatases and IL-6 stimulation leads to the SHP2-dependent activation of MAPKs, it also links the Grb2–SOS complex and Gab1 to gp130. Phosphorylated Gab1 acts as an adapter and is involved in the indirect association of SHP-2 and PI-3 kinase. Downstream activation of Vav1, Rac-1 and MAP2K4 is necessary for the IL-6-mediated STAT3 phosphorylation and transactivation to accomplish its effects. STAT3 is also phosphorylated by PKCD and it causes inhibition of STAT3 DNA binding and transcriptional activity. PTPN11 and SOCS3 exert inhibitory function and thus lead to down regulation of the signaling cascade.

It is an important part of hemostasis (the cessation of blood loss from a damaged vessel), wherein a damaged blood vessel wall is covered by a platelet and fibrin-containing clot to stop bleeding and begin repair of the damaged vessel. Disorders of coagulation can lead to an increased risk of bleeding (hemorrhage) or clotting (thrombosis).

Hs_Polyol_Pathway_WP690_72132.gpml	Polyol Pathway|When glucose is unused, it is metabolized via the polyol pathway. This pathway consists of two main enzymatic steps. First, glucose is reduced to sorbitol by aldose reductase. In this step, NADPH is oxidized to NADP+. The next step is the oxidation of sorbitol to D-fructose by sorbitol dehydrogenase. Fructose can then be phosphorylated by fructokinase and subsequently be metabolized via dihydroxyacetone phosphate or glyceraldehyde to D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, which can be used as a substrate in the process of glycolysis. The sorbitol pathway plays a role in diabetic renal complications because aldose reductase metabolizes the excess of glucose to toxic metabolites that induce hyperfiltration and glomerular dysfunction.

Hs_Nuclear_Receptors_in_Lipid_Metabolism_and_Toxicity_WP299_70027.gpml	Nuclear Receptors in Lipid Metabolism and Toxicity|Nuclear receptors are transcription factors that are activated upon binding to its ligands. Initially, they had been classified as classic endocrine nuclear hormone receptors and orphan receptors. However, further studies have led to the identification of lipid ligands for some of these adopted orphan receptors, which are responsible for lipid metabolism, storage or elimination. One of the characteristics of these receptors is that they act by forming heterodimers with retinoid X receptor (RXR). The receptors include peroxisome proliferators-Activated receptors (PPARs) for fatty acids, liver X receptor (LCR) for oxysterols, Farnesoid X receptors (FXR) for bile acids and steroid xenobiotic receptor/X receptor (SXR/PXR or Nsil2) for xenobiotics. Other orphan receptors also require RXR for its functions are vitamin D receptor (VDR) for vitamin D and retinoic acid receptor (RAR) for retinoid acids, although these receptors are not involved in lipid metabolism. Upon binding to various ligands, three classes of proteins are synthesized including lipid binding proteins, the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and cytochrome P450 member proteins which catalyzes lipid anabolism, metabolism and elimination. In addition to lipid metabolism, some members of the cytochrome P450 family genes are responsible for activation of procarcinogens, detoxification of environmental toxins and metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics. In particular, CAR, Nsil2 and recently identified VDR are important in up-regulation of these cytochromes. Of all the human cytochrome P450 genes, only a few CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4 account for most toxicity effects, specifically CYP3A is responsible for clearing approximately half of the clinically prescribed drugs. For instance, acetaminophen, one of the most commonly used drug, is toxic in high doses due to the activation of CAR and the drugs subsequent conversion to acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI) by CYP1A2, CYP2E1 and CYP3A.

Hs_Thyroxine_(Thyroid_Hormone)_Production_WP1981_70955.gpml	Thyroxine (Thyroid Hormone) Production|Thyroxine hormone is produced in the thyroid gland from tyrosine and iodine. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is produced by the hypothalamus. It stimulates the production of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in the anterior pituitary gland, which affects the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR). Iodine is captured by a hydrogen peroxide trap procuced by thyroid peroxidase and added to the 3' and 5' postitions of tyrosine. This can either be free tyrosine or a tyrosine residue in thyroglobuline. After the multiple iodination steps this produces T3 and T4.  The production of the thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4),tri-iodothyronine (T3) and reverse T3 (rT3) is dependent on the organification of iodine into thyroglobulin (Tg), the major protein product of the thyroid (2). This involves thyroid peroxidase catalyzed iodination of tyrosine residues in Tg to form mono- and di-iodotyrosines and their subsequent crosslinking to form the iodothyronines T3 and T4.  Iodine 131 is an important radioactive fallout product. It was released in the atmosphere after nuclear tests and after nuclear incidents like at Tchernobyl and Fukushima. Since the iodine is concentrated in the thyroid glant as a substrate for the process described here non-radioactive iodine 127 is given as competitor to people exposed.	SLC5A5	TRH	TSHR	TSH

In mice loss of signaling by any member of the ErbB family results in embryonic lethality with defects in organs including the lungs, skin, heart and brain. Excessive ErbB signaling is associated with the development of a wide variety of types of solid tumor. ErbB-1 and ErbB-2 are found in many human cancers and their excessive signaling may be critical factors in the development and malignancy of these tumors.  The ErbB protein family consists of 4 members  * ErbB-1, also named epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) * ErbB-2, also named HER2 in humans and neu in rodents * ErbB-3, also named HER3 and * ErbB-4, also named HER4  The four members of the ErbB protein family are capable of forming homodimers, heterodimers, and possibly higher order oligomers upon activation by a subset of potential growth factor ligands.

Hs_IL-9_Signaling_Pathway_WP22_72098.gpml	IL-9 Signaling Pathway|IL-9 is a multifunctional cytokine, belong to a family of cytokines. IL-9 was initially reported as a T cell growth factor in mice. It is now known to target multiple cell types. It plays an important role in the expansion and recruitment of mast cells in response to intestinal nematode infection or during autoimmune encephalomyelitis. It is also known to act on various cell types known to be involved in asthma including T cells, B cells, mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, and epithelial cells. IL 9 can promote the expression of TGF-beta in lipopolysaccharide induced monocytes and macrophages. IL-9 is also known to play important roles in conditions including airway inflammation, EAE and parasitic infections. Mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is activated transiently by IL-9, which in turn leads to the growth stimulation of hematopoietic cell lines. IL-9 signals through the heterodimeric receptor composed of a specific chain (IL-9R) and a gamma chain (IL2RG), which is shared between IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL15 and IL-21. The IL-9R and IL-2RG associates with JAK1 and JAK3 respectively. Receptor engagement results in JAK1- JAK3 cross phosphorylation and activation of the JAK proteins which leads to the activation of Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT-1, STAT-3 and STAT-5) and Insulin receptor substrate 1 and 2 (IRS1 and IRS2)/PI3K cascades. IL-9 stimulation also results in the activation of MEK/ERK signaling cascade.  Please access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/IL_9_pathway.html NetSlim] database.

Hs_Arachidonate_Epoxygenase_-_Epoxide_Hydrolase_WP678_71506.gpml	Arachidonate Epoxygenase / Epoxide Hydrolase|The cytochrome P450-dependent formation of polyunsaturated fatty acid epoxides is an important biochemical pathway creating mediators of inflammation and blood pressure regulation.  Once formed these compounds can be incorperated into phospholipid membrance, and released by the action of phospholipase A2.  The epoxides of arachidonic acid, i.e. the epoxyeicosatrieneoic acid or EETs, are putative endothelial derived hyperpolarization factors which increase the open state probability of Ca++ sensitive K+ channels, leading to vasodilation in arteriolar beds.  The 11(12)-EET in particular appears to have potent functions in vasodilation, and are inhibitors of NFKb dependent inflammatory signalling, and PAI-1 activity.  The 5(6)-EET appears unique, in that its metabolic transformation through cyclooxygenase activities produces potent vasoconstrictors.  With the exception of the 5(6)-EET, these epoxy fatty acids are good substrates for the soluble epoxide hydrolase.  Hydrolytic tranformation to vicinal diols eliminates vasoactive actions, however these vicinal diols have been reported to have other biological activites, including PPAR-alpha activation.  Recent development of inhibitors of the soluble epoxide hydrolase are proving to have potent anti-inflammatory, anti-hypertensive, and anti-nociceptive properties.  Reports of enzyme catalyzed glutathione-conjugates of the epoxy fatty acids have been reported, but the activity and relavance of these potential metabolic products are unknown to date.

Hs_Oxidative_Stress_WP408_69029.gpml	Oxidative Stress|Oxidative stress represents an imbalance between the production and manifestation of reactive oxygen species and a biological system's ability to readily detoxify the reactive intermediates or to repair the resulting damage. Disturbances in the normal redox state of tissues can cause toxic effects through the production of peroxides and free radicals that damage all components of the cell, including proteins, lipids, and DNA. Some reactive oxidative species can even act as messengers through a phenomenon called redox signaling. In humans, oxidative stress is involved in many diseases. Examples include Sickle Cell Disease,[1] atherosclerosis, Parkinson's disease, heart failure, myocardial infarction, Alzheimer's disease, Schizophrenia, Bipolar disorder, fragile X syndrome[2] and chronic fatigue syndrome, but short-term oxidative stress may also be important in prevention of aging by induction of a process named mitohormesis.[3] Reactive oxygen species can be beneficial, as they are used by the immune system as a way to attack and kill pathogens.

Hs_Sulfation_Biotransformation_Reaction_WP692_69031.gpml	Sulfation Biotransformation Reaction|Metabolism of xenobiotic compounds consists of phase I and a phase II biotransformation reactions, being compound modification and conjugation reactions respectively. In phase I biotransformation, the compound is modificated via oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, or other minor reactions, to reveal a reactive group to which a conjugation molecule can react to. In phase II, a small conjugation molecule reacts with the phase I modified molecule, producing a much more water-soluble molecule that can be excreted more easily. Sulfation is a phase II biotransformation reaction in which sulfate acts as a conjugation molecule and binds to a substrate via the catalysis of sulfotransferases. Sulfate is first combined with ATP molecules to form PAPS via the dual function enzymes PAPSS1 and PAPSS2 consisting of a sulfurylase domain and an APS kinase domain. From PAPS the sulfate group is transferred to the actual substrate via the action of sulfotransferases, resulting in a sulfated substrate and the sulfate-lacking PAP.

Hs_Codeine_and_Morphine_Metabolism_WP1604_74317.gpml	Codeine and Morphine Metabolism|The principal pathways for metabolism of codeine occur in the liver, although some metabolism occurs in the intestine and brain. Approximately 50-70% of codeine is converted to codeine-6-glucuronide by UGT2B7. Codeine-6-glucuronide has a similar affinity to codeine for the mu opioid receptor, coded for by the OPRM1 gene. Approximately 10-15% of codeine is N-demethylated to norcodeine by CYP3A4. Norcodeine also has a similar affinity to codeine for the mu opioid receptor. Between 0-15% of codeine is O-demethylated to morphine, the most active metabolite, which has 200 fold greater affinity for the mu opioid receptor compared to codeine. This metabolic reaction is performed by CYP2D6.  Approximately 60% of morphine is glucuronidated to morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) while 5-10% is glucuronidated to morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G). These reactions are principally catalyzed by UGT2B7 in the liver. UGT1A1 may have a minor role in the formation of M3G , and UGT1A1 and UGT1A8 are capable of catalyzing the formation of M6G in vitro and so contribute to this pathway, although UGT1A8 is minimally expressed in liver and so is not depicted here. M6G has a higher affinity for OPRM1 than morphine and M3G and so the ratio of morphine to M6G is considered an important indicator of analgesic effect.  Transporters are also depicted in this pathway, as they influence clearance of codeine, morphine and their metabolites. Some of the evidence for the involvement of these transporters was derived from experiments done in mice and may or may not be translatable to human pharmacokinetics. The transporters present at the blood-brain barrier, not depicted in this pathway, as well as metabolic enzymes and transporters in the brain and GI tract, likely also play an important role in the pharmacokinetics of codeine and morphine.

Hs_ATM_Signaling_Pathway_WP2516_72241.gpml	ATM Signaling Pathway|Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a highly pleiotropic, autosomal recessive disease that leads to multisystem defects and has an intricate cellular phenotype, all linked to the functional inactivation of a single gene. Extensive research on the phenotype and the recent discovery and cloning of the responsible gene point to a defect as a central biochemical locus which links several signal transduction pathways that operate under stress as well as in normal physiological conditions.  Ataxia is the first symptom in all patients and is predominantly truncal, first manifested in swaying of the head and trunk on standing and even sitting. Truncal ataxia precedes appendicular cerebellar disease. In the first years of life, certain manifestations are present such as dysarthria, muscular hypotonia, the slow initiation and performance of all voluntary movements, characteristic hypotonic facies and postures, and drooling. Dyssynergia and intention tremor of the upper extremities become a major feature after the fifth year of life. The tendon reflexes are diminished or lost, but may be normal or even hyperactive in the early stages. All these observations show a clear ataxia of cerebellar type, initially of station and gait, and later of intention. Early observations of brains from patients with A-T showed neurodegenerative changes, particularly in the Purkinje and granular cells of the cerebellum. Neuronal degeneration is also present in the brainstem, and dentate and olivary nuclei atrophy. Neuronal loss occurs in the substantial nigra and oculomotor nuclei, dorsal root ganglia, and degenerative changes are evident in spinal motor neurons, and dorsal root and sympathetic motor neurons. Moreover, multiple abnormalities in Purkinje cell development have been observed in an Atm-deficient mouse model. Misplaced Purkinje cells have been observed in both the granular and molecular cell layers. In addition, Purkinje cell dendrites tend to grow laterally instead of extending towards the surface of the cerebellum.  ATM (for Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) has been located by restriction-fragment length polymorphism in the chromosome 11, location: 108,093,211-108,239,829. Interestingly, the site of ATM is the same or adjacent to the region occupied by CD3 (Antigen, Delta subunit), THY1 (T-Cell antigen), and NCAM (Cell Adhesion Molecule, Neural, 1) genes, all of which are members of the immunoglobulin-gene superfamily and consequently may be subject to the same defect that afflicts the T-cell receptor and immunoglobulin molecules in A-T. The ATM gene presents an open reading frame (ORF) of 9,165 kb cDNA and is constituted by 66 exons spread over 150 kb of genomic DNA which has a transcript of 12 kb. The ORF of this transcript predicts a 370-kDa protein composed of 3056 amino acids. Over 300 mutations have been found in A-T patients, distributed across the full length (150 kb of genomic DNA) of the ATM gene.  Sequence homology indicates that the atm gene product falls into a family of proteins that are related to the catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). This family includes TEL1, MEC1, TOR1, and TOR2 of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, RAD3 of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and MEI-41 of Drosophila melanogaster. The mammalian family member most closely related to ATM is the ATR/FRP1 protein and, like its yeast homologs, it mediates cellular responses to unreplicated or damaged DNA. In humans the PI 3-kinase family includes the catalytic subunit of the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs) and FRAP. These sequence homologies appear to reflect functional homology because many of the PI 3-kinase family members are involved in DNA repair, recombination and cell cycle control. Despite the resemblance to lipid kinases, members of this family, including ATM, possess a serine/threonine protein kinase activity, which is wortmannin sensitive.  ATM phosphoprotein is ubiquitously expressed and predominantly found in nuclei of proliferating cells, but subcellular fractionation and immunofluorescence revealed that 10-20% of the protein is present in cytoplasmic vesicles, including peroxisomes and endosomes and a prominent cytoplasmic fraction in mouse oocytes. ATM is endosome-bound in mouse neurons, suggesting molecular sorting of the protein occurs in the cytoplasm. In Purkinje cells, distribution of ATM protein is primarily in cytoplasm, and this may be related to the differentiation state of the cells. ATM mRNA is present in all human and mouse tissues. In situ hybridization shows that ATM mRNA is expressed throughout the whole mouse embryo. Furthermore, ATM has been associated with β-adaptin in lymphoblast vesicles indicating that it may play a role in intracellular vesicle and/or protein transport mechanisms. No obvious nuclear localization signals have been detected in ATM. Neither an ectopically expressed N-terminal fragment of the protein nor a C-terminal fragment is capable of entering the nucleus.

Hs_Toll-like_receptor_signaling_pathway_WP75_72133.gpml	Toll-like receptor signaling pathway|Specific families of pattern recognition receptors are responsible for detecting microbial pathogens and generating innate immune responses. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are membrane-bound receptors identified as homologs of Toll in Drosophila. Mammalian TLRs are expressed on innate immune cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, and respond to the membrane components of Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria. Pathogen recognition by TLRs provokes rapid activation of innate immunity by inducing production of proinflammatory cytokines and upregulation of costimulatory molecules. TLR signaling pathways are separated into two groups: a MyD88-dependent pathway that leads to the production of proinflammatory cytokines with quick activation of NF-{kappa}B and MAPK, and a MyD88-independent pathway associated with the induction of IFN-beta and IFN-inducible genes, and maturation of dendritic cells with slow activation of NF-{kappa}B and MAPK.

Hs_TNF_alpha_Signaling_Pathway_WP231_72093.gpml	TNF alpha Signaling Pathway|Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFŒ±) is a proinflammatory cytokine involved in various biological processes including regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and immune response. TNFŒ± is mainly produced by macrophages, also by other tissues including lymphoid cells, mast cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts and neuronal tissues. TNF was identified as a soluble cytokine produced upon the activation by the immune system and able to exert cytotoxicity on tumor cell lines and cause tumor necrosis in animal models. TNF is primarily produced as a type II transmembrane protein arranged as stable homotrimers. The members of TNFŒ± family exert their cellular effect through two distinct surface receptors of the TNF receptor family, TNFRSF1A (TNF-R1) and TNFRSF1B (TNF-R2). TNF-R1 is ubiquitously expressed, whereas TNF-R2 is found typically on cells of the immune system and is highly regulated. TNF-R1 and TNF-R2 binds membrane-integrated TNF (memTNF) as well as soluble TNF (sTNF) TNF-R1 contains a protein-protein interaction domain, called death domain (DD). This domain interacts with other DD-containing proteins and couples the death receptors to caspase activation and apoptosis. TNF-R2 induces gene expression by a TRAF-2 dependent signaling mechanism and also crosstalk's with TNF-R1. The pleiotropic biological effects of TNF can be attributed to its ability to simultaneously activate multiple signaling pathways in cells. Binding of TNFŒ± to TNF-R1 on the cell surface triggers trimerization of the receptor and exposes intracellular domain of TNF-R1 following the release of an inhibitory protein. This intracellular domain recruits a death-domain containing adaptor protein, TRADD by homophilic interactions. TRADD, which acts as a scaffold protein, recruits TRAF2 and RIPK1 to form a complex , referred to as complex 1.  Complex 1 is believed to be important in NF-Œ∫B activation and JNK activation. Complex 1 eventually dissociates from the receptor and integrates FADD and procaspase8 to form a complex referred to as the complex 2. In some cases, FADD/CASP8 association depends on high molecular weight complexes containing unubiquitinated RIPK1 as scaffold. Activated CASP8 induces CASP3 activity and execution of apoptosis. CASP8 activates apoptotic signal through another mechanism involving BID cleavage to truncated BID (tBID). tBID translocates to the mitochondria, increasing its outer membrane permeability. This results in cytochrome C release and activation of other caspases ultimately leading to apoptosis. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been found to increase during or after complex 1 and 2 formation to mediate or potentiate apoptosis upon TNF stimulation. TRAF-2 in complex 1 also activates the MAP kinase cascade, that leads to the activation of JNK, which on prolonged activation is believed to mediate both apoptosis and necrotic cell death.  On complex 1 formation, NF-Œ∫B regulated anti-apoptotic gene products efficiently block initiation of apoptosis by complex 2. There is evidence of an early attempt to signal for apoptosis, which precedes the activation of NF-Œ∫B. The intracellular part of TNF-R1 binds to NSMAF which in turn mediates SMPD2-dependant ceramide production from cell membrane. Ceramide induces membrane permeabilization and apoptosis. This is observed before TNF-R1 internalization and NF-Œ∫B activation. This process is repressed on TNF-R1 internalization. This signal however is enough to initiate apoptosis in some cells. Another form of cell death, necrosis, is also mediated through TNF stimulation. On TNF stimulation, deubiquitinated RIPK1 dissociates from complex 1 and recruits RIPK3, FADD and CASP8. RIPK3 is autophosphorylated and phosphorylates RIPK1. Taken together, it has been speculated that RIP1 and RIP3 increase carbohydrate and glutamine metabolism of the cell, leading to increased ROS production and eventual necrosis. Recruitment of CASP8, activation of FADD/RIP1 and apoptosis induction, is blunted when RIPK1 becomes ubiquitinated. IKBKG binds to ubiquitinated RIPK1 to induce the activation of NF-Œ∫B, which exerts antiapoptotic effects. Cellular inhibitor of apoptosis, BIRC2 and BIRC3 has E3-ubiquitin ligase activity and functionally interact with TRAF2 and RIPK1  to induce polyubiquitination of RIPK1 upon TNF stimulation. Loss of these inhibitors attenuates TNF-induced NF-Œ∫B activation. The adaptor proteins TAB2 and TAB3 bind preferentially to Lys-63 polyubiquitinated RIPK1. This facilitates dimerization of MAP3K7, promoting its phosphorylation and activation. The IKK complex, consisting of CHUK, IKBKB and IKBKG, is recruited to RIP1 through binding of IKBKG to the ubiquitin chain of RIP1. Activated TAK1 directly phosphorylates IKBKB within the activation loop, leading to activation of the IKK complex and NF-Œ∫B. Certain regulatory proteins have been known to intercept NF-Œ∫B activation at the level of ubiquitinated RIP1. TNFAIP3, an NF-Œ∫B inhibitory protein, removes Lys-63 polyubiquitin chain and promotes Lys-48 linked ubiquitination of RIPK1 leading to its degradation and NF-Œ∫B signal termination. IKBKG stabilizes the bound polyubiquitinated RIPK1 by inhibiting its degradation, most probably by impairing its interaction with TNFAIP3. OTUD7B is recruited to the activated TNF-R1 and promotes RIP1 deubiquitination, thereby attenuating NF-Œ∫B activation. At internalized TNF-receptosomes, RIPK1 is ubiquitinated by endocytic vesicle associated RFFL, inducing RIPK1 degradation, which terminates NF-Œ∫B activation. When successful, TNF-induced NF-Œ∫B activation induces transcription and expression of genes encoding proinflammatory IL-6, anti-apoptotic factors BIRC2, BIRC3 and BCL-2 homologue BCL2L1. This causes the cell to remain inert to apoptotic stimuli.  Please access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/tnf_alpha_pathway.html NetSlim] database.

Hs_NAD_Biosynthesis_II_(from_tryptophan)_WP2485_70025.gpml	NAD Biosynthesis II (from tryptophan)|As a general rule, most prokaryotes utilize the aspartate de novo pathway, in which the nicotinate moiety of NAD is synthesized from aspartate (see NAD biosynthesis I (from aspartate)). In eukaryotes, the de novo pathway starts with tryptophan (this pathway).  The role of tryptophan as a precursor in eukaryotic NAD biosynthesis was first suggested by nutritional studies in which humans stricken with pellagra, a nicotinamide (niacine) deficiency disease, recovered after the addition of tryptophan or niacin to their diets [Krehl45]. Other studies established tryptophan as a precursor of NAD in many animal and plant systems [Foster80a]. This pathway is closely related to the catabolic pathway of tryptophan (tryptophan degradation I (via anthranilate)), suggesting an evolutionary link between the two.  Though rare, the synthesis of NAD from tryptophan in prokaryotes has been observed in several organisms. Wilson and Henderson reported that Xanthomonas arboricola pv. pruni requires niacin for growth and can use tryptophan or 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid as a substitute [Wilson63]. Some members of the Actinomycete group were also reported to utilize tryptophan for NAD biosynthesis [Lingens64].  Recent studies based on comparative genome analysis have identified the five genes involved in the "eukaryotic" pathway in several bacterial strains, confirming that some bacteria may indeed utilize this pathway rather than the aspartate pathway [Kurnasov03].  In yeast, the de novo pathway consists of six enzymatic steps (catalyzed by the products of the BNA genes) and one non-enzymatic reaction. After the last enzymatic reaction (catalyzed by Bna6p), the de novo pathway converges with the salvage pathway [Panozzo02].  In plants:  In plants current evidence strongly supports the NAD biosynthetic route from L-aspartate (NAD biosynthesis I (from aspartate)). However, the finding of gene homologs encoding enzymes of the early steps in the kynurenine pathway (this pathway) in the genome sequence of rice (Oryza sativa) does not rule out this pathway in monocotyledones and remains to be further investigated [Katoh06] [Katoh04].

Hs_Type_II_diabetes_mellitus_WP1584_72094.gpml	Type II diabetes mellitus|Insulin resistance is strongly associated with type II diabetes. "Diabetogenic" factors including FFA, TNFalpha and cellular stress induce insulin resistance through inhibition of IRS1 functions. Serine/threonine phosphorylation, interaction with SOCS, regulation of the expression, modification of the cellular localization, and degradation represent the molecular mechanisms stimulated by them. Various kinases (ERK, JNK, IKKbeta, PKCzeta, PKCtheta and mTOR) are involved in this process.  The development of type II diabetes requires impaired beta-cell function. Chronic hyperglycemia has been shown to induce multiple defects in beta-cells. Hyperglycemia has been proposed to lead to large amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in beta-cells, with subsequent damage to cellular components including PDX-1. Loss of PDX-1, a critical regulator of insulin promoter activity, has also been proposed as an important mechanism leading to beta-cell dysfunction.   Although there is little doubt as to the importance of genetic factors in type II diabetes, genetic analysis is difficult due to complex interaction among multiple susceptibility genes and between genetic and environmental factors. Genetic studies have therefore given very diverse results. Kir6.2 and IRS are two of the candidate genes. It is known that Kir6.2 and IRS play central roles in insulin secretion and insulin signal transmission, respectively.

Hs_IL-5_Signaling_Pathway_WP127_70017.gpml	IL-5 Signaling Pathway|Interleukin 5 (IL-5) ligand belongs to the cytokine superfamily. IL-5 is a glycoprotein which belongs to the cytokine superfamily. It possesses the four helical bundle motifs that is conserved among several hematopoietic cytokines. IL-5 plays an important role in the proliferation and differentiation of eosinophils. IL-5 induces terminal maturation of eosinophils, prolongs eosinophils survival by delaying apoptotic death, increases eosinophils adhesion to endothelial cells and enhances eosinophils effector function. IL-5 plays important roles in the pathogenesis of asthma, hypereosinophilic syndromes and eosinophil-dependent inflammatory diseases. IL-5 is produced by eosinophils, mast cells, Th2 cells, Tc2 cells and gamma delta T cells. IL-5 exerts influence on different biological activities by associating with the IL-5 receptor. This receptor is a heterodimeric complex consisting of an alpha chain-IL5RA and a beta chain, CSF2RB, which is shared between IL-5 receptor, IL-3 receptor and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor receptor. Binding of IL-5 to the receptor complex results in the recruitment of adapter proteins including SHC1, GRB2 and SOS1. This leads to the activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade. Subsequent activation of transcription factors including JUN and ELK-1 regulates the expression of genes involved in the control of cell growth and differentiation. IL-5 stimulation also resulted in the activation of PI3K/AKT/RPS6K pathway resulting in the phosphorylation of RPS6 and regulation of gene expression. JAK phosphorylation and activation is also brought about by IL-5, which in turn results in the activation and nuclear translocation of STAT proteins. The STAT transcription factors are responsible for the expression of early response genes and feedback inhibitor of JAK/STAT pathway. In addition, IL-5 is known to activate various tyrosine kinases such as LYN, BTK and SYK. The interactions and intersections between canonical and non-canonical IL-5 signaling systems are depicted in the pathway map.

The Notch pathway is named after the Drosophila mutants that showed irregular notches of missing tissue at the insect wing blade tips. The Notch gene was cloned in 1985. Proteins of the Notch families are single-pass transmembrane proteins that function both as cell surface receptors and nuclear transcriptional regulators. Four Notch receptors (Notch 1-4) have been identified in mammals. Mature Notch receptors are non-covalent heterodimers consisting of an extracellular subunit (NEC) and a transmembrane subunit (NTM). NEC possess multiple EGF-like repeats and three specialized Lin-Notch repeats (LNR) that forms a tight hydrophobic interaction with extracellular stump of NTM. This region masks an A disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) cleavage site. The region where these two subunits interact is called the heterodimerization domain (HD). Notch ligands are also transmembrane proteins with multiple EGF-like repeats, a short cytoplasmic tail and a specialized delta-serrate-lag2 (DSL) domain at the N-terminus. There are five canonical Notch ligands i.e. Jagged (JAG1 and JAG2), Delta-like (DLL1, DLL3, DLL4) in mammals. Notch signaling activation occurs upon ligand-receptor binding, which are expressed on two adjacent cells. Ligand binding causes dissociation of NEC from NTM, unmasking the ADAM cleavage site. The NEC fragment is trans- endocytosed into the ligand expressing cells. The full-length receptor minus the NEC fragment is cleaved at the membrane by ADAM17 generating an intermediate, Notch extracellular truncation (NEXT). This is further cleaved by γ-secretase that generates an active Notch intracellular fragment (NIC) or Notch intracellular domain (NICD). The γ-secretase complex is composed of PSEN1, PSEN2, PSENEN, NCSTN and APH1 (A or B). Following these two cleavage steps, the NICD is released into the cytoplasm and translocates into the nucleus to regulate transcription of Notch target genes. Upon translocation into the nucleus, NICD binds to RBPJ which is a constitutive repressor of Notch signaling. RBPJ represses Notch target gene expression by recruiting a co-repressor complex, which includes NCOR1, NCOR2, SNW1, CIR, HDAC1, HDAC2, SPEN and FHL1 and SAP30. NICD binding to RBPJ replaces the co-repressor complex with a co-activator complex which includes MAML1-3, EP300 and SNW1. Primary Notch target genes include two families of transcriptional factors Hes, including HES1 and HES5 as well as Hey including HEY1 and HEY2. Other Notch target genes include CCND1, CDKN1A, GATA3 and PTCRA. CNTN1 acts as a functional ligand of Notch. This trans-extracellular interaction causes γ-secretase-dependent nuclear translocation of the NICD. This signaling is involved in oligodendrocyte precursor cell differentiation and upregulation of myelin-related protein MAG. In addition to the canonical Notch pathway, there is increasing evidence showing RBPJ independent non-canonical pathways. been fully characterized. Physical interaction of NOTCH-1IC with LCK- PI3K may mediate non-nuclear cross-talk with AKT, leading to survival signaling. Notch stimulation through AKT pathway leads to down regulation of MYC expression. Activation of SRC/STAT3 pathway by Notch signaling is dependent on the expression of Notch effector HES1 transcription factor. The induction of HES1 enhanced SRC phosphorylation. This activated SRC kinase was found to be responsible for the enhanced phosphorylation of STAT3. The HES1 and HES5 proteins associate with and facilitate the complex formation between JAK2 and STAT3, thus promoting STAT3 phosphorylation and activation. The activated STAT3 translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and induces transcriptional activation of target gene expression (including HIF1A).

Hs_Wnt_Signaling_Pathway_Netpath_WP363_70630.gpml	Wnt Signaling Pathway Netpath|WNT signal, through the canonical pathway, controls cell fate determination and through the non-canonical pathway controls cell movement and tissue polarity. The name "wnt" is a fusion of two terms, wg derived from the Drosophila gene wingless (wg) and int derived from the proto-oncogene integration-1, which is the mammalian homolog of wg. ß-catenin is the key regulated effector of Wnt, involved in canonical signaling . Free ß-catenin is bound by a multiprotein "destruction complex". The ß-catenin destruction complex is comprised of ß-catenin, scaffold proteins (APC, AXIN) and serine/threonine kinases that phosphorylate ß-catenin casein kinase 1 (CSNK1A1, CSNK1D, CSNK1E, CSNK1G1) and GSK3B. The sequential phosphorylation of ß-catenin by casein kinase 1 and GSK3 is recognised by an SCF-class E3-ubiquitin ligase, which targets it for polyubiquitination and proteosomal destruction. Canonical WNT signals are transduced through a two-part receptor, a seven-transmembrane Frizzled (FZD) and low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5/6 (LRP5/LRP6) to a ß-catenin (CTNNB1) signaling cascade. On recruitment of deshevelled (DVL1) to FZD and AXIN to LRP6, ß-catenin destruction complex disassembles leading to its stabilization and nuclear accumulation. Nuclear ß-catenin binds to T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) family of transcription factors and Legless family docking protein, BCL9. These activate the transcription of Wnt target genes CCND1, MYC. Non-canonical WNT signaling diverges downstream after being transduced through FZD family receptors and co-receptors, ROR2 and RYK. This pathway does not involve ß-catenin-mediated gene expression. Small G proteins such as RAC1, RHOA and downstream effectors of RAC including JNK are DVL-dependant effector molecules of the non-canonical pathway. These have been implicated in cytoskeletal rearrangement, dendrite growth and control of cell polarity and orientation. Nemo-like kinase (NLK) and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) are Ca2+-dependant effectors of the non-canonical pathway. NLK inhibits canonical pathway by phosphorylation of TCF/LEF family transcription factors. NFAT transcription factor is implicated in convergent extension during early embryogenesis and carcinogenic metastasis.

Hs_Prostaglandin_Synthesis_and_Regulation_WP98_72088.gpml	Prostaglandin Synthesis and Regulation|A prostaglandin is any member of a group of lipid compounds that are derived enzymatically from fatty acids and have important functions in the animal body. Every prostaglandin contains 20 carbon atoms, including a 5-carbon ring. They are mediators and have a variety of strong physiological effects, such as regulating the contraction and relaxation of smooth muscle tissue.[1] Prostaglandins are not hormones, but autocrine or paracrine, which are locally acting messenger molecules. They differ from hormones in that they are not produced at a discrete site but in many places throughout the human body. Also, their target cells are present in the immediate vicinity of the site of their secretion (of which there are many). The prostaglandins, together with the thromboxanes and prostacyclins, form the prostanoid class of fatty acid derivatives, a subclass of eicosanoids.

Hs_MAPK_Signaling_Pathway_WP382_72103.gpml	MAPK Signaling Pathway|The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade is a highly conserved module that is involved in various cellular functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation and migration. Mammals express at least four distinctly regulated groups of MAPKs, extracellular signal-related kinases (ERK)-1/2, Jun amino-terminal kinases (JNK1/2/3), p38 proteins (p38alpha/beta/gamma/delta) and ERK5, that are activated by specific MAPKKs: MEK1/2 for ERK1/2, MKK3/6 for the p38, MKK4/7 (JNKK1/2) for the JNKs, and MEK5 for ERK5. Each MAPKK, however, can be activated by more than one MAPKKK, increasing the complexity and diversity of MAPK signalling. Presumably each MAPKKK confers responsiveness to distinct stimuli. For example, activation of ERK1/2 by growth factors depends on the MAPKKK c-Raf, but other MAPKKKs may activate ERK1/2 in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli.

In spite of the wide range of cellular processes that the TGF&#x3b2; signaling pathway regulates, the process is relatively simple. TGF&#x3b2; superfamily ligands bind to a type II receptor, which recruits and phosphorylates a type I receptor.

Hs_Amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis_(ALS)_WP2447_72245.gpml	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)|Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive, lethal, degenerative disorder of motor neurons. The hallmark of this disease is the selective death of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord, leading to paralysis of voluntary muscles. Mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), as seen in some familial ALS (FALS) cases, is unstable, forming aggregates in the motor neuron cytoplasm, axoplasm and mitochondria. Within mitochondria, mutant SOD1 may interfere with the anti-apoptotic function of Bcl-2, affect mitochondrial import by interfering with the translocation machinery (TOM/TIM), and generate toxic free radicals (ROS). Reactive oxygen species (ROS), produced within mitochondria, inhibit the function of EAAT2, the main glial glutamate transporter protein, responsible for most of the reuptake of synaptically released glutamate. Glutamate excess increases intracellular calcium, which enhances oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage. Mutant SOD1 can also trigger oxidative reactions , which can then cause damage through the formation of hydroxyl radicals or via nitration of tyrosine residues on proteins. Nitration may target neurofilament proteins, affecting axonal transport. Collectively, these mechanisms are predicted to disturb cellular homeostasis, ultimately triggering motor neuron death.

Hs_IL-2_Signaling_Pathway_WP49_72047.gpml	IL-2 Signaling Pathway|IL-2 is a multifunctional cytokine with pleiotropic effects on several cells of the immune system. IL-2 was originally discovered as a T cell growth factor, but it was also found to have actions related to B cell proliferation, and cytolytic activity of natural killer cells. IL-2 also activates lymphokine activated killer cells. In contrast to its proliferative effects, IL-2 also has potent activity in a process known as activation-induced cell death. More recently, IL-2 was shown to promote tolerance through its effects on regulatory T cell development. IL-2 clinically has anti-cancer effects as well as utility in supporting T cell numbers in HIV/AIDS. There are three classes of IL-2 receptors, binding IL-2 with low, intermediate, or high-affinity. The low affinity receptor (IL-2RŒ± alone) is not functional; signaling by IL-2 involves either the high affinity hetero-trimeric receptor containing IL-2RŒ±, IL-2RŒ≤ and the common cytokine receptor gamma chain (originally named IL-2RŒ≥ and now generally denoted as Œ≥c) or the intermediate affinity heterodimeric receptor composed of IL-2RŒ≤ and Œ≥c. IL-2 stimulation induces the activation of the Janus family tyrosine kinases JAK1 and JAK3, which associate with IL-2RŒ≤ and Œ≥c, respectively. These kinases in turn phosphorylate IL-2RŒ≤ and induce tyrosine phosphorylation of STATs (signal transducers and activators of transcription) and various other downstream targets. The downstream signaling pathways activated by IL-2 also involves mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling modules, leading to both mitogenic and anti-apoptotic signals.

Hs_Nicotine_Activity_on_Chromaffin_Cells_WP1603_70559.gpml	Nicotine Activity on Chromaffin Cells|Nicotine is an alkaloid found in tobacco plants. It is a substance that acts as a stimulant in humans and is one of the main factors responsible for tobacco dependence. When nicotine enters the body, it is distributed quickly through the bloodstream, and it can cross the blood-brain barrier to enter the central nervous system (CNS). It binds to two main types of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors: the ganglion type and the CNS type.  In chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla, nicotine binds to the ganglion-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, which is composed of alpha 3 (CHRNA3) and beta 4 (CHRNB4) subunits. By binding to the receptors, nicotine causes cell depolarization and an influx of calcium through voltage dependent calcium channels. Calcium triggers the release of epinephrine from the chromaffin vesicles into the bloodstream, which leads to increased heart rate and blood pressure and elevation of blood glucose level.

Hs_AGE-RAGE_pathway_WP2324_71701.gpml	AGE/RAGE pathway|Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are heterogeneous group of non-enzymatic malliard reaction products of aldose sugar with proteins and lipids. Formation of AGEs is an indicator of one of the many chemical modifications of proteins and DNA that occur within the biological systems. Research over past two decades have implicated the role of AGEs in most of the age-related diseases like Alzheimer’s disease, cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, renal disorders, hypertension, stroke, visual impairment and skin disorders. AGEs also modify the skin collagen and accelerates the aging process. In diabetic patients, AGE formation occurs in large scale and manifests with clinical symptoms such as cataract, atherosclerosis, nephropathy and neuropathy.  AGEs are known to bind with different cell surface receptors such as receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), dolichyldiphosphooligosaccharide-protein glycosyltransferase (AGE-R1), protein kinase C substrate, 80KH phosphoprotein (AGE-R2), galectin-3 (AGE-R3), and class A macrophage scavenger receptor types I and II.  RAGE, is the well-studied receptor for AGEs and the signaling events mediated by others are either not been identified or are considered as negative regulators of RAGE signaling. RAGE is an integral membrane protein of the immunoglobulin superfamily. RAGE is constituted of an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain and a short cytoplasmic domain. RAGE is expressed in a wide range of tissues such as lung, heart, kidney, brain, skeletal muscles, and in different types of cells including endothelial cells, macrophages/monocytes, neutrophils, and lymphocytes. Besides AGEs, RAGE also mediate the effects of its other extracellular ligands namely extracellular high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1), S100 family of calcium binding proteins and amyloid-beta peptide, among many others. Although a large number of advanced glycation end products have been identified in humans, AGE/RAGE signaling ex-vivo is mostly studied using the AGEs such as AGE-modified albumin, N(6)(carboxymethyl)lysine, N(6)(carboxyethyl)lysine and pentosidine.  The signaling events mediated by RAGE are complex due to the diversity of its ligands and their effects in different cell types. Homodimerization of RAGE has been identified to be essential for RAGE signaling. Depending on the intensity and duration of RAGE ligation, specific signaling modules such as ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, CDC42/RAC, SAPK/JNK and NF-κB has been shown to be regulated in different cell types. AGEs have been shown to induce the formation of complexes containing RAGE with DIAPH1, SRC/IRS1/PKC-alpha, TIRAP/MYD88/IRAK4 and RHOA. RAGE-DIAPH1 interaction is required for the activation of RAC1/CDC42 pathway leading to neurite outgrowth and regulation of cytoskeleton.Activation of PKC-alpha through RAGE/SRC/IRS1/PKC-alpha by AGEs has been suggested as a mechanism of insulin resistance in skeletal muscle cells. RAGE also shares the adaptor molecules such as TIRAP, MYD88 and IRAK4 of toll-like receptors and induce the activation of AKT, p38MAPK and NFKB pathways. AGEs have also been shown to induce the formation of complex between RAGE and RHOA. RHOA/ROCK dependent phosphorylation of ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) is required for the regulation of gap formation and actin reorganization, and thereby endothelial permeability. However, in tubular cells, AGEs inhibit phosphorylation of ERMs leading to inhibition of tubulogenesis. Similarly, AKT have been shown to be activated by AGEs and induce proliferation of primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells where as phosphorylation of AKT is shown to be inhibited in podocytes leading to FOXO4 activation and apoptosis. The major component of AGE/RAGE signaling is the oxidative stress induced pathways. AGEs induce the oxidative stress through the activation of NADPH oxidases. Increased intracellular oxidative stress leads to stimulation of PKC and ERK1/2, resulting in the translocation and activation of NF-κB and subsequent up regulation of NF-κB dependent genes which ultimately produce deleterious effects to cells.

Several NP formulations were shown to interact with cellular receptors such as the EGFR and integrins, inducing cellular phenotypes such as proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and migration. In lung epithelial cells, NPs interact with both EGFR and integrins, leading to cell proliferation via activation of PI3K and AKT. NPs were shown to activate the EGFR, leading in parallel to apoptosis and proliferation, and oncogenic Ras mutations might influence these effects. Interestingly, while integrin-mediated activation of ERK was instrumental for proliferation, apoptosis was mediated via activation of JNK. In addition, NPs (PM2.5) are able to bind the EGFR to activate the MAPK signaling cascade. Activation of ERK leads to the expression and secretion of the epidermal growth factor amphiregulin, thus forming an autocrine loop, which might be instrumental for sustained inflammatory responses.

Hs_SIDS_Susceptibility_Pathways_WP706_74443.gpml	SIDS Susceptibility Pathways|In this model, we provide an integrated view of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) at the level of implicated tissues, signaling networks and genetics. The purpose of this model is to serve as an overview of research in this field and recommend new candidates for more focused or genome wide analyses. SIDS is the sudden and unexpected death of an infant (less than 1 year of age), almost always during deep sleep, where no cause of death can be found by autopsy. Factors that mediate SIDS are likely to be both biological and behavioral, such as sleeping position, environment and stress during a critical phase of infant development (http://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/Sudden_Infant_Death_Syndrome.cfm). While no clear diagnostic markers currently exist, several polymorphisms have been identified which are significantly over-represented in distinct SIDS ethnic population. The large majority of these polymorphisms exist in genes associated with neuronal signaling, cardiac contraction and inflammatory response. These and other lines of evidence suggest that SIDS has a strong autonomic nervous system component (PMID:12350301, PMID: 20124538). One of the neuronal nuclei most strongly implicated in SIDS has been the raphe nucleus of the brain stem. In this nuclei there are ultrastructural, cellular and molecular changes associated with SIDS relative to controls (PMID:19342987, PMID: 20124538). This region of the brain is responsible for the large majority of neuronal serotonin produced and is functionally important in the regulation of normal cardiopulmonary activity, sleep and thermoregulation (see associated references).  Genes associated with serotonin synthesis and receptivity have some of the strongest genetic association with SIDS. Principle among these genes the serotonin biosynthetic enzyme TPH2, the serotonin transporter SLC6A4 and the serotonin receptor HTR1A. SLC6A4 exhibits decreased expression in the raphe nucleus of the medulla oblongata and polymorphisms specifically associated with SIDS (PMID:19342987). In 75% of infants with SIDS, there is decreased HTR1A expression relative to controls along with an increase in the number of raphe serotonin neurons (PMID:19342987). Over-expression of the mouse orthologue of the HTR1A gene in the juvenile mouse medulla produces an analogous phenotype to SIDS with death due to bradycardia and hypothermia (PMID:18599790). These genes as well as those involved in serotonin synthesis are predicted to be transcriptionally regulated by a common factor, FEV (human orthologue of PET-1). PET-1 knock-out results in up to a 90% loss of serotonin neurons (PMID:12546819), while polymorphisms in FEV are over-represented in African American infants with SIDS. In addition to FEV, other transcription factors implicated in the regulation of these genes (Putative transcriptional regulators (TRs)) and FEV are also listed (see associated references). In addition to serotonin, vasopressin signaling and its regulation by serotonin appear to be important in a common pathway of cardiopulmonary regulation (PMID:2058745). A protein that associates with vasopressin signaling, named pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (ADCYAP1), results in a SIDS like phenotype, characterized by a high increase in spontaneous neonatal death, exacerbated by hypothermia and hypoxia (PMID:14608012), when disrupted in mice. Protein for this gene is widely distributed throughout the central nervous system (CNS), including autonomic control centers (PMID:12389210). ADCYAP1 and HTR1A are both predicted to be transcriptionally regulated by REST promoter binding. Regulation of G-protein coupled signaling pathways is illustrated for these genes, however, it is not clear whether ADCYAP1 acts directly upon raphe serotonin neurons.   Another potentially important class of receptors in SIDS is nicotine. Receptors for nicotine are expressed in serotonin neurons of the raphe throughout development (PMID:18986852).  Application of nicotine or cigarette smoke is sufficient to inhibit electrical activity of raphe serotonin neurons (PMID:17515803) and chronic nicotine infusion in rats decreases expression of SLC6A4 (PMID:18778441). Furthermore, nicotine exposure reduces both HTR1A and HTR2A immunoreactivity in several nuclei of the brainstem (PMID:17451658).  In addition to CNS abnormalities, several studies have identified a critical link between cardiac arrhythmia (long QT syndrome) and SIDS (PMID:18928334). A number of genetic association studies identified functionally modifying mutations in critical cardiac channels in as many as 10% of all SIDS cases (PMID:18928334). These mutations have been predicted to predispose infants for long QT syndrome and sudden death. The highest proportion of SIDS associated mutations (both inherited and sporadic) is found in the sodium channel gene SCN5A. Examination of putative transcriptional regulators for these genes, highlights a diverse set of factors as well as a relatively common one (SP1).  Finally, several miscellaneous mutations have been identified in genes associated with inflammatory response and thermoregulation. Infection is considered a significant risk factor for SIDS (PMID:19114412). For inflammatory associated genes, such as TNF alpha, interleukin 10 and complement component 4, many of these mutations are only significant in the presence of infection and SIDS. In addition to these mutations, cerebrospinal fluid levels of IL6 are increased in SIDS cases as well as IL6R levels in the arcuate nucleus of the brain, another major site of serotonin synthesis (PMID:19396608). Genes such as ILR6 and ADCYAP1 are also associated with autoimmune disorders, thus SIDS may also be associated with autoinflammation of autonomic centers in the brain. Regulation of thermogenesis by brown adipose tissue has been proposed be an important component of SIDS, given that SIDS incidence is highest in the winter time and that animal models of SIDS demonstrate variation in body temperature. Interestingly, activation of raphe HTR1A decreases both shivering and peripheral vasoconstriction in piglets (18094064). Although a putative significant polymorphism was identified in the thermoregulator gene HSP60, this only occurred in one SIDS case. It is important to note that in the large majority of all these studies, sleeping position and smoking were among the most significant risk factors for SIDS.

This is seen in the heart, during the plateau phase of ventricular contraction. In this example, calcium acts to maintain depolarisation of the heart.

Hs_Glycerophospholipid_Biosynthetic_Pathway_WP2533_71989.gpml	Glycerophospholipid Biosynthetic Pathway|Glycerophospholipids or phosphoglycerides, in which the hydrophobic regions are composed of two fatty acids joined to glycerol; and sphingolipids, in which a single fatty acid is joined to a fatty amine, sphingosine, are glycerol-based phospholipids and the main component of biological membranes. The hydrophilic moieties in these amphipathic compounds may be as a simple as a single -OH at one end of the sterol ring system, or they may be more complex. Glycerophospholipds, as well as sphingolipids, contained polar or charged alcohols at their polar ends; some also contain phosphate groups.  In glycerophospholipids, two fatty acids are ester-linked to glycerol at C-1 and C-2, and a highly polar or charged (and therefore hydrophilic) head group is attached to C-3 through a phosphodiester bond. All glycerophospholipds are derivatives of phosphatidic acid and are named for their polar head groups (e.g., phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine). All have a negative charge on the phosphate group at pH 7.0. The head-goup alcohol may also contribute one or more charges at pH near 7.0. The fatty acids in glycerophospholipds can be any of a wide variety. They are different in different species, in different tissues of the same species, and in different types of glycerophospholipids in the same cell or tissue. In general, glycerophospholipids contain a saturated fatty acid at C-1 and an unsaturated fatty acid at C-2, and, in general terms, the fatty acyl groups are generally 16 or 18 carbons long.  Eukaryotic membranes contain significant amounts of two other types of glycerophospholipids: Plasmalogens and Alkylacylglycerophospholipids. Plasmalogens contain a hydrocarbon chain linked to glycerol C-1 via vinyl ether linkage whereas alkylacylglycerophospholipids the alkyl substituent at glycerol C-1 is attached via an ether linkage. About 20% of mammalian glycerophospholipids are plasmalogens, this percentage varies both from species to species and from tissue to tissue within a given organism. While plasmalogens comprise only about 0.8% of the phospholipids in human liver, they account for around 23% of those in human nervous tissue. The alkylacylglycerophospholipids are less abundant than the plasmalogens, e.g., about 59% of ethanolamine glycerophospholipids of human heart are plasmalogens, whereas only 3.6% are alkylacylglycerophospholipids. However, in bovine erythrocytes, 75% of the ethanolamine glycerophospholipids are of alkylacyl type.	A2	EC	C

Hs_Glycogen_Metabolism_WP500_63201.gpml	Glycogen Metabolism|Glycogen is a very large, branched polymer of glucose residues. Within skeletal muscle and liver glucose is stored as glycogen. In the liver, glycogen synthesis and degradation are regulated to maintain blood-glucose levels as required to meet the needs of the organism as a whole. In contrast, in muscle, these processes are regulated to meet the energy needs of the muscle itself.   Glycogen synthesis Glycogen synthesis is, unlike its breakdown, endergonic. This means that glycogen synthesis requires the input of energy. Energy for glycogen synthesis comes from UTP, which reacts with glucose-1-phosphate, forming UDP-glucose, in reaction catalyzed by UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase. Glycogen is synthesized from monomers of UDP-glucose by the enzyme glycogen synthase, which progressively lengthens the glycogen chain with (a1->4) bonded glucose. As glycogen synthase can only lengthen an existing chain, the protein glycogenin is needed to initiate the synthesis of glycogen. The glycogen-branching enzyme, amylo (a1->4) to (a1->6) transglycosylase, catalyzes the transfer of a terminal fragment of 6-7 glucose residues from a nonreducing end to the C-6 hydroxyl group of a glucose residue deeper into the interior of the glycogen molecule. The branching enzyme can act upon only a branch having at least 11 residues, and the enzyme may transfer to the same glucose chain or adjacent glucose chains.  Glycogen degradation Glycogen degradation consists of three steps: (1) the release of glucose 1-phosphate from glycogen, (2) the remodeling of the glycogen substrate to permit further degradation, and (3) the conversion of glucose 1-phosphate into glucose 6-phosphate for further metabolism.

There are at least three different Wnt pathways: the canonical pathway, the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway and the Wnt/Ca2+ pathway. In the canonical Wnt pathway, the major effect of Wnt ligand binding to its receptor is the stabilization of cytoplasmic beta-catenin through inhibition of the bea-catenin degradation complex. Beta-catenin is then free to enter the nucleus and activate Wnt-regulated genes through its interaction with TCF (T-cell factor) family transcription factors and concomitant recruitment of coactivators. Planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling leads to the activation of the small GTPases RHOA (RAS homologue gene-family member A) and RAC1, which activate the stress kinase JNK (Jun N-terminal kinase) and ROCK (RHO-associated coiled-coil-containing protein kinase 1) and leads to remodelling of the cytoskeleton and changes in cell adhesion and motility. WNT-Ca2+ signalling is mediated through G proteins and phospholipases and leads to transient increases in cytoplasmic free calcium that subsequently activate the kinase PKC (protein kinase C) and CAMKII (calcium calmodulin mediated kinase II) and the phosphatase calcineurin.

Hs_IL-1_signaling_pathway_WP195_74010.gpml	IL-1 signaling pathway|The IL-1 family of cytokines currently consists of 11 members which are encoded by distinct genes and includes IL-1α, IL-1β, and the IL-1 Receptor antagonist (IL-1RA). The major role of IL-1 type cytokines is to control pro-inflammatory reactions in response to tissue injury - either due to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or Danger associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Interleukin-1 (IL-1), which includes IL-1α and IL-1β, plays a crucial role in many auto inflammatory diseases. IL- 1α and IL-1β are produced predominantly by macrophages and monocytes, and to a lesser extent by other cell types such as epithelial cells endothelial cells and fibroblasts. IL-1 alpha, is a membrane anchored protein which signals through autocrine or juxtracrine mechanisms where as the soluble IL-1β acts in a paracrine or systemic manner. Significant progress has been achieved in the study of the signaling events mediated by IL-1 and the processes they control. Involvement of IL-1α or IL-1β in host responses to infections caused by intracellular microorganisms such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis as well as in autoinflammatory diseases makes its signaling components important candidates for drug targetting for these diseases. The two forms of IL-1 (IL-1α and IL-1β) bind to the same cellular receptor, the Type I IL- 1 receptor (IL-1RI) to induce signaling. Upon receptor engagement, IL-1R1 forms a heterodimer with IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP), which functions as a co receptor. IL-1RAcP cannot bind directly to IL-1 but is essential for IL-1-mediated signaling. Binding of IL-1 to this receptor complex leads to the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB through different signaling mechanisms. Two IL-1 receptor-associated kinases, IRAK-1 and IRAK-2 have been implicated in the activation of NF-κB. IRAK 1 and 2 functions as adapter proteins and protein kinases to transmit downstream signals. It recruits TRAF6 to the IL-1 receptor complex via an interaction with IL-1RAcP. Oligomerization of TRAF6 and subsequent formation of TAK1 and MEKK3 signaling complexes relays the signal via NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) to two I-kappaB kinases (IKK-1 and -2), leading to NF-kappaB activation. Activation of other mitogen activated protein kinases, including JNKs and p38 MAPK through various MAP2Ks also play important roles in mediating IL-1 responses by activating transcription through the AP-1 transcription factor. The above mentioned signaling events co-operatively induce the expression of IL-1 target genes such as CCL2, IL-8 and IL-6. The interactions and intersections between canonical and non-canonical Interleukin-1 signaling systems are depicted in the pathway map. Regulation of IL-1 signaling can be brought about by various mechanisms. The IL-1 family member IL-1RA can bind to the IL1-R1 receptor with similar affinity as IL-1α and β, but is incapable of activating the signaling response. The type II IL-1 receptor can bind to IL-1 alpha and beta but lacks signaling capacity. The naturally occurring 'shed' domains of the extracellular IL-1 receptor chains (IL-1RI, IL-1RII and IL- 1RAcP) also act as inhibitors of IL-1 signaling. In the cell, IL-1R binds to toll- interacting protein (TOLLIP), which results in the inhibition of IRAK1 and by promoting efficient degradation of IL-1R by targeting the internalized receptor to endosomes. Other mechanisms such as p38MAPK mediated phosphorylation of TAB1 which results in the inactivation of TAK1, and expression of genes including MAPK phosphatase 1 (MKP-1) and Inhibitor of kappa B alpha (NFKBIA) that inhibit IL-1 signaling components also serve as negative regulators of IL-1 signaling.

Hs_Oncostatin_M_Signaling_Pathway_WP2374_73668.gpml	Oncostatin M Signaling Pathway|Oncostatin M (OSM) is a member of the multifunctional cytokine interleukin 6 (IL6) - type cytokine family. It is mainly produced in cell types such as activated T lymphocytes, macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils and in microglial cells. OSM signaling is initiated by the interaction of the cytokine to either: the type I LIFR-gp130 receptor complex, or to the type II OSMR-gp130 receptor [1]. The major downstream signaling pathways that are activated in OSM signaling are JAK/STAT, Ras/Raf/MAPK and PI3K pathways [2-5]. As the receptors lacks intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, associated JAKs (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2) phosphorylate OSM receptor complex and STATs (STAT1, STAT3, STAT5A, STAT5B, STAT6) [1, 6-8]. Phosphorylated STATs form homodimeric complexes (STAT1, STAT3, STAT5B) or heterodimeric complex (STAT1-STAT3) and translocate to the nucleus. Once inside nucleus STAT proteins bind to regulatory elements in the promoter of OSM-responsive genes and regulate the gene expression [1-3, 8]. Alternatively, OSM induced phosphorylation of PTPN11, GRB2, SHC1, Ras/Raf molecules can bring about the activation of ERK1/2 signaling module [1]. Oncostatin M -through ERK1/2 signaling module induces the phosphorylation of CEBPB, both CEBPB and EGR1 stimulates the transcription of genes involved in lipid metabolism [9]. Although OSM also causes induced phosphorylation in MAPK family members (MAPK8/9/14) the functional importance of this is at present not well understood [1, 11]. OSM mediated signaling cascade is negatively regulated by JAK1 inhibition by SOCS3 and STAT3 inhibition by PIAS3 [4-5, 10].OSM also induced the activation of caspase family members (CASP3, CASP7, CASP9) through the JAK2 module and regulates apoptosis [12-14]. In osteosarcoma cells OSM is found to mediate apoptosis through a less understood STAT5B signaling module [14].   1.
